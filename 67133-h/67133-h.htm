  <p>The Hidatsas, called Minitaris by the Mandans, are a Siouan tribe and
    speak a language closely akin to that of the Crows. Wars with the
    Dakota Sioux forced them to ally themselves with the Mandans, whose
    culture they adopted. Lewis and Clark found the two tribes living in
    five villages at the mouth of the Knife river, in 1804.</p>

  <p>In 1832 the artist Catlin visited the Five Villages, as they were
    called. A year later Maximilian of Wiet visited them with the artist
    Bodmer. Several score canvasses, the work of the two artists, are
    preserved to us.</p>

  <p>Smallpox nearly exterminated the two tribes in 1837-8. The survivors,
    a mere remnant, removed to Fort Berthold reservation where they still
    dwell.</p>

  <p>In 1908, with my brother, an artist, I was sent by Dr. Clark Wissler,
    Curator of Anthropology, American Museum of Natural History, to begin
    cultural studies among the Hidatsas. This work, continued through
    successive summers for ten years, is but now drawing to a close.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span></p>

  <p>During these years my faithful interpreter and helper has been Edward
    Goodbird, grandson of Small Ankle, a chief of the Hidatsas in the
    trying years following the terrible smallpox winter; and my principal
    informants have been Goodbird’s mother, <i>Waheenee-wea</i>, or
    Buffalo-Bird Woman, and her brother, Wolf Chief.</p>

  <p>The stories in this book were told me by Buffalo-Bird Woman. A few told
    in mere outline, have been completed from information given by Wolf
    Chief and others.</p>

  <p>Illustrations are by my brother, from studies made by him on the
    reservation. They have been carefully compared with the Catlin and
    Bodmer sketches. Not a few are redrawn from cruder sketches by
    Goodbird, himself an artist of no mean ability.</p>

  <p>Acknowledgment is made of the courtesy of Curator Wissler, whose
    permission makes possible the publishing of this book.</p>

  <p>Indians have the gentle custom of adopting very dear friends by
    relationship terms. By such adoption Buffalo-Bird Woman is my mother.
    It is with real pleasure that I offer to young readers these stories
    from the life of my Indian mother.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak">A LITTLE INDIAN GIRL</h2>
  </div>

  <p>I was born in an earth lodge by the mouth of the Knife river, in what
    is now North Dakota, three years after the smallpox winter.</p>

  <p>The Mandans and my tribe, the Hidatsas, had come years before from the
    Heart river; and they had built the Five Villages, as we called them,
    on the banks of the Knife, near the place where it enters the Missouri.</p>

  <p>Here were bottom lands for our cornfields and cottonwood trees for the
    beams and posts of our lodges. The dead wood that floated down either
    river would help keep us in firewood, the old women thought. Getting
    fuel in a prairie country was not always easy work.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>

  <p>When I was ten days old my mother made a feast and asked an old man
    named Nothing-but-Water to give me a name. He called me Good Way. “For
    I pray the gods,” he said, “that our little girl may go through life by
    a <i>good way</i>; that she may grow up a good woman, not quarreling
    nor stealing; and that she may have good luck all her days.”</p>

  <div class="figleft illowp56">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_008.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>I was a rather sickly child and my father wished after a time to give
    me a new name. We Indians thought that sickness was from the gods.
    A child’s name was given him as a kind of prayer. A new name, our
    medicine men thought, often moved the gods to help a sick or weakly
    child.</p>

  <p>So my father gave me another name, <i>Waheenee-wea</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> or
    Buffalo-Bird Woman. In our Hidatsa language, <i>waheenee</i>, means
    cowbird, or buffalo-bird, as this little brown bird is known in the
    buffalo country; <i>wea</i>, meaning girl or woman, is often added to a
    girl’s name that none mistake it for the name of a boy. I do not know
    why my father chose this name. His gods, I know, were birds; and these,
    we thought, had much holy power. Perhaps the buffalo-birds had spoken
    to him in a dream.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span></p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1">[1]</a> Wä hēē´ nēē wē´ a
  </div>

  <p>I am still called by the name my father gave me; and, as I have lived
    to be a very old woman, I think it has brought me good luck from the
    gods.</p>

  <p>My mother’s name was <i>Weahtee</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> She was one of four sisters,
    wives of my father; her sisters’ names were Red Blossom, Stalk-of-Corn,
    and Strikes-Many Woman. I was taught to call all these my mothers. Such
    was our Indian custom. I do not think my mother’s sisters could have
    been kinder to me if I had been an own daughter.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2">[2]</a> Wē´ äh tēē
  </div>

  <p>I remember nothing of our life at the Five Villages; but my
    great-grandmother, White Corn, told me something of it. I used to creep
    into her bed when the nights were cold and beg for stories.</p>

  <p>“The Mandans lived in two of the villages, the Hidatsas in three,” she
    said. “Around each village, excepting on the side that fronted the
    river, ran a fence of posts, with spaces between for shooting arrows.
    In front of the row of posts was a deep ditch.</p>

  <p>“We had corn aplenty and buffalo meat to eat in the Five Villages, and
    there were old people and little children in every lodge. Then smallpox
    came. More than half of my tribe died in the smallpox winter. Of the
    Mandans only a few families were left alive. All the old people and
    little children died.”</p>

  <p>I was sad when I heard this story. “Did any of your family die,
    grandmother?” I asked.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

  <p>“Yes, my husband, Yellow Elk, died. So many were the dead that there
    was no time to put up burial scaffolds; so his clan fathers bore Yellow
    Elk to the burying ground and laid him on the grass with logs over him
    to keep off the wolves.</p>

  <div class="figleft illowp48">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_010.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>“That night the villagers heard a voice calling to them from the
    burying ground. ‘<i>A-ha-hey!</i><a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> I have waked up. Come for me.’</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3">[3]</a> Ä hä he̱y´
  </div>

  <p>“‘It is a ghost,’ the villagers cried; and they feared to go.</p>

  <p>“Some brave young men, listening, thought they knew Yellow Elk’s voice.
    They went to the burying ground and called, ‘Are you alive, Yellow Elk?’</p>

  <p>“‘Yes,’ he answered, ‘I have waked up!’</p>

  <p>“The young men rolled the logs from his body and bore Yellow Elk to the
    village; he was too weak to walk.”</p>

  <p>This story of Yellow Elk I thought wonderful; but it scared me to know
    that my great-grandfather had been to the ghost land and had come back
    again.</p>

  <p>Enemies gave our tribes much trouble after the smallpox year, my
    grandmother said. Bands <span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>of Sioux waylaid hunting parties or came
    prowling around our villages to steal horses. Our chiefs, Mandan and
    Hidatsa, held a council and decided to remove farther up the Missouri.
    “We will build a new village,” they agreed, “and dwell together as one
    tribe.”</p>

  <p>The site chosen for the new village was a place called Like-a-Fishhook
    Point, a bit of high bench land that jutted into a bend of the
    Missouri. We set out for our new home in the spring, when I was four
    years old. I remember nothing of our march thither. My mothers have
    told me that not many horses were then owned by the Hidatsas, and that
    robes, pots, axes, bags of corn and other stuff were packed on the
    backs of women or on travois dragged by dogs.</p>

  <div class="figright illowp62">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_011.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>The march was led by the older chiefs and medicine men. My grandfather
    was one of them. His name was Missouri River. On the pommel of his
    saddle hung his medicines, or sacred objects, two human skulls wrapped
    in a skin. They were believed to be the skulls of thunder birds, who,
    before they died, had changed themselves into Indians. After the
    chiefs, in a long line, came warriors, women, and children. Young men
    who owned ponies were sent ahead to hunt meat for the evening camp.
    Others rode up and down the line to speed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span> stragglers and to see
    that no child strayed off to fall into the hands of our enemies, the
    Sioux.</p>

  <p>The earth lodges that the Mandans and Hidatsas built, were dome-shaped
    houses of posts and beams, roofed over with willows-and-grass, and
    earth; but every family owned a tepee, or skin tent, for use when
    hunting or traveling. Our two tribes camped in these tents the first
    summer at Like-a-Fishhook Point, while they cleared ground for
    cornfields.</p>

  <p>The labor of clearing was done chiefly by the women, although the older
    men helped. Young men were expected to be off fighting our enemies or
    hunting buffaloes. There was need for hunting. Our small, first year’s
    fields could yield no large crops; and, to keep from going hungry
    in the winter months, we must lay in a good store of dried meat. We
    owned few guns in the tribe then; and hunting buffaloes with arrows
    was anything but sport. Only young men, strong and active, made good
    hunters.</p>

  <p>My mothers were hard-working women, and began their labor of clearing a
    field almost as soon as camp was pitched. My grandmother, Turtle, chose
    the ground for the field. It was in a piece of bottom land that lay
    along the river, a little east of the camp. My mothers had brought seed
    corn from the Five Villages; and squash, bean and sunflower seed.</p>

  <p>I am not sure that they were able to plant much corn the first season.
    I know they planted some beans and a few squashes. I am told that
    when the squash harvest came in, my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span> grandmother picked out a long
    green-striped squash for me, for a doll baby. I carried this about on
    my back, snuggled under my buffalo-calf robe, as I had seen Indian
    mothers carry their babies. At evening I wrapped my dolly in a bit of
    skin and put her to bed.</p>

  <div class="figright illowp54">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_013.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>Our camp on a summer’s evening was a cheerful scene. At this hour,
    fires burned before most of the tepees; and, as the women had ended
    their day’s labors, there was much visiting from tent to tent. Here
    a family sat eating their evening meal. Yonder, a circle of old men,
    cross-legged or squat-on-heels in the firelight, joked and told
    stories. From a big tent on one side of the camp came the <i>tum-tum
    tum-tum</i> of a drum. We had dancing almost every evening in those
    good days.</p>

  <p>But for wee folks bedtime was rather early. In my father’s family, it
    was soon after sunset. My mothers had laid dry grass around the tent
    wall, and on this had spread buffalo skins for beds. Small logs, laid
    along the edge of the beds, caught any sparks from the fireplace; for,
    when the nights grew chill, my mothers made their fire in the tepee. My
    father often sat and sang me to sleep by the firelight.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

  <p>He had many songs. Some of them were for little boys: others were for
    little girls. Of the girls’ songs, there was one I liked very much; it
    was something like this:</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">My sister asks me to go out and stretch the smoke-flap.</div>
        <div class="i4">My armlets and earrings shine!</div>
        <div class="i0">I go through the woods where the elm trees grow.</div>
        <div class="i4">Why do the berries not ripen?</div>
        <div class="i0">What berries do you like best?—the red? the blue?</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This song I used to try to sing to my squash doll, but I found it hard
    to remember the words.</p>

    <div class="large mt2">SECOND CHAPTER</div>
    <h2 class="nobreak">WINTER CAMP</h2>
  </div>

  <p>The medicine men of the two tribes had laid out the plan of our new
    village when they made camp in the spring. There was to be an open
    circle in the center, with the lodges of the chiefs and principal men
    opening upon it; and in the center of the circle was to stand the
    Mandans’ sacred corral. This corral was very holy. Around it were held
    solemn dances, when young men fasted and cut their flesh to win favor
    of the gods.</p>

  <p>The early planning of the village by our medicine men made it possible
    for a woman to choose a site and begin building her earth lodge. Few
    lodges, however, were built the first summer. My mothers did not even
    begin building theirs; but they got ready the timbers with which to
    frame it.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span></p>

  <p>Going often into the woods with their dogs to gather firewood, they
    kept a sharp lookout for trees that would make good beams or posts;
    these they felled later, and let lie to cure. For rafters, they cut
    long poles; and from cottonwood trunks they split puncheons for the
    sloping walls. In olden days puncheons were split with wedges of
    buffalo horn. A core of hard ash wood was driven into the hollow horn
    to straighten it and make it solid.</p>

  <p>Autumn came; my mothers harvested their rather scanty crops; and, with
    the moon of Yellow Leaves, we struck tents and went into winter camp.
    My tribe usually built their winter village down in the thick woods
    along the Missouri, out of reach of the cold prairie winds. It was
    of earth lodges, like those of our summer village, but smaller and
    more rudely put together. We made camp this winter not very far from
    Like-a-Fishhook Point.</p>

  <p>My father’s lodge, or, better, my mothers’ lodge,—for an earth lodge
    belonged to the women who built it—was more carefully constructed than
    most winter lodges were. Earth was heaped thick on the roof to keep in
    the warmth; and against the sloping walls without were leaned thorny
    rosebushes, to keep the dogs from climbing up and digging holes in the
    roof. The fireplace was a round, shallow pit, with edges plastered
    smooth with mud. Around the walls stood the family beds, six of them,
    covered each with an old tent skin on a frame of poles.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

  <p>A winter lodge was never very warm; and, if there were old people or
    children in the family, a second, or “twin lodge,” was often built.
    This was a small lodge with roof peaked like a tepee, but covered with
    bark and earth. A covered passage led from it to the main lodge.</p>

  <p>The twin lodge had two uses. In it the grandparents or other feeble or
    sickly members of the family could sit, snug and warm, on the coldest
    day; and the children of the household used it as a playhouse.</p>

  <p>I can just remember playing in our twin lodge, and making little feasts
    with bits of boiled tongue or dried berries that my mothers gave me.
    I did not often get to go out of doors; for I was not a strong little
    girl, and, as the winter was a hard one, my mothers were at pains to
    see that I was kept warm. I had a tiny robe, made of a buffalo-calf
    skin, that I drew over my little buckskin dress; and short girls’
    leggings over my ankles. In the twin lodge, as in the larger earth
    lodge, the smoke hole let in plenty of fresh air.</p>

  <p>My mothers had a scant store of corn and beans, and some strings of
    dried squashes; and they had put by two or three sacks of dried prairie
    turnips. A mess of these turnips was boiled now and then and was very
    good. Once, I remember, we had a pudding, dried prairie turnips pounded
    to a meal and boiled with dried June berries. Such a pudding was sweet,
    and we children were fond of it.</p>

  <p>To eke out our store of corn and keep the pot boiling, my father hunted
    much of the time.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span> To hunt deer he left the lodge before daybreak, on
    snowshoes, if the snow was deep. He had a flintlock gun, a smoothbore
    with a short barrel. The wooden stock was studded with brass nails. For
    shot he used slugs, bits of lead which he cut from a bar, and chewed to
    make round like bullets. Powder and shot were hard to get in those days.</p>

  <div class="figleft illowp45">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_018.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>Buffaloes were not much hunted in winter, when they were likely to
    be poor in flesh; but my father and his friends made one hunt before
    midwinter set in. Buffaloes were hunted with bow and arrows, from
    horseback. Only a fleet pony could overtake a buffalo, and there were
    not many such owned in the tribe. We thought a man rich who had a good
    buffalo horse.</p>

  <p>My father stabled his horses at night in our lodge, in a little corral
    fenced off against the wall. “I do not want the Sioux to steal them,”
    he used to say. In the morning, after breakfast, he drove them out upon
    the prairie, to pasture, but brought them in again before sunset. In
    very cold weather my mothers cut down young cottonwoods and let our
    horses browse on the tender branches.</p>

  <p>Early in the spring our people returned to Like-a-Fishhook Point and
    took up again the labor of clearing and planting fields. Each family<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
    had its own field, laid out in the timbered bottom lands along the
    Missouri, if possible, in a rather open place where there were no large
    trees to fell.</p>

  <div class="figright illowp58">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_019.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>Felling trees and grubbing out bushes were done with iron tools, axes
    and heavy hoes, gotten of the traders. I have heard that in old times
    my tribe used stone axes, but I never saw them myself. Our family field
    was larger than any owned by our neighbors; and my mothers were at
    pains to add to it, for they had many mouths to feed. My grandmother,
    Turtle, helped them, rising at the first sound of the birds to follow
    my mothers to the field.</p>

  <p>Turtle was old-fashioned in her ways and did not take kindly to iron
    tools. “I am an Indian,” she would say, “I use the ways my fathers
    used.” Instead of grubbing out weeds and bushes, she pried them from
    the ground with a wooden digging stick. I think she was as skillful
    with this as were my mothers with their hoes of iron.</p>

  <p>Digging sticks are even yet used by old Hidatsa women for digging wild
    turnips. The best kind is made of a stout ash sapling, slightly bent
    and trimmed at the root end to a three-cornered point. To harden the
    point, it is oiled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span> with marrow fat, and a bunch of dry grass is tied
    around it and fired. The charring makes the point almost as hard as
    iron.</p>

  <div class="figleft illowp52">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_020a.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>Turtle, I think, was the last woman in the tribe to use an
    old-fashioned, bone-bladed hoe. Two other old women owned such hoes,
    but no longer used them in the fields. Turtle’s hoe was made of the
    shoulder bone of a buffalo set in a light-wood handle, the blade firmly
    bound in place with thongs. The handle was rather short, and so my
    grandmother stooped as she worked among her corn hills.</p>

  <p>She used to keep the hoe under her bed. As I grew a bit older my
    playmates and I thought it a curious old tool, and sometimes we
    tried to take it out and look at it, when Turtle would cry, “<i>Nah,
      nah!</i><a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Go away! Let that hoe alone; you will break it!”</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4">[4]</a> Näh
  </div>

  <p>We children were a little afraid of Turtle.</p>

  <p>The winter I was six years old my mother, <i>Weahtee</i>, died.</p>

  <p>The Black Mouths, a men’s society, had brought gifts to One Buffalo and
    asked him to be winter chief. “We know you own sacred objects, and have
    power with the gods,” they said. “We want you to pray for us and choose
    the place for our camp.”</p>

  <p>One Buffalo chose a place in the woods at the mouth of Many-Frogs
    Brook, three miles from Like-a-Fishhook village. I remember our journey
    thither. There was a round, open place in the trees by Many-Frogs
    Brook, where young men fasted and made offerings to the gods. It was
    a holy place; and One Buffalo thought, if we pitched our winter camp
    near-by, the gods would remember us and give us a good winter.</p>

  <p>But it was a hard winter from its start. Cold weather set in before we
    had our lodges well under cover; and, with the first snow, smallpox
    broke out in camp. Had it been in summer, my tribe could have broken up
    into small bands and scattered; and the smallpox would have died out.
    This they could not do in winter, and many died. My brother, my mother
    <i>Weahtee</i>, and her sister Stalk-of-Corn, died, of my father’s
    family.</p>

  <p>Although my old grandmother was good to me, I often wept for my mother.
    I was lonesome in our winter lodge, and we Indian children did not
    have many playthings. Old Turtle made me a dolly of deer skin stuffed
    with antelope hair. She sewed on two white bone beads for eyes. I bit
    off one of these bone beads, to see if it was good to eat, I suppose.
    For some days my dolly was one-eyed, until my grandmother sewed on a
    beautiful new eye, a blue glass bead she had gotten of a trader. I
    thought this much better, for now my dolly had one blue eye and one
    white one.</p>

  <p>I liked to play with my father’s big hunting cap. It was made of
    buffalo skin, from the part near the tail where the hair is short. He
    wore it with the fur side in. Two ears of buffalo skin, stuffed with
    antelope hair to make them stand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span> upright, were sewed one on each side.
    They were long, to look like a jack rabbit’s ears; but they looked
    more like the thumbs of two huge mittens. My father, I think, had had
    a dream from the jack-rabbit spirits, and wore the cap as a kind of
    prayer to them. Jack rabbits are hardy animals and fleet of foot. They
    live on the open prairies through the hardest winters; and a full grown
    rabbit can outrun a wolf. An Indian hunter had need to be nimble-footed
    and hardy, like a jack rabbit.</p>

  <p>Small Ankle thought his cap a protection in other ways. It kept his
    head warm. Then, if he feared enemies were about, he could draw his cap
    down to hide his dark hair, creep up a hill and spy over the top. Being
    of dull color, like dead grass, the cap was not easily seen on the sky
    line. A Sioux, spying it, would likely think it a coyote, or wolf, with
    erect, pointed ears, peering over the hill, as these animals often did.
    There were many such caps worn by our hunters; but most of them had
    short pointed ears, like a coyote’s.</p>

  <p>My father sometimes hung his cap, wet with snow, on the drying poles
    over the fire to dry. I would watch it with longing eyes; and, when
    I thought it well warmed, I would hold up my small hands and say,
    “Father, let me play with the cap.” I liked to sit in it, my small
    ankles turned to the right, like an Indian woman’s; for I liked the
    feel of the warm fur against my bare knees. At other times I marched
    about the lodge, the big cap set loosely on my head,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span> and my dolly
    thrust under my robe on my back. In doing this I always made my
    grandmother laugh. “Hey, hey,” she would cry, “that is a warrior’s cap.
    A little girl can not be a warrior.”</p>

  <div class="figleft illowp65">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_024.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>The winter, if hard, was followed by an early spring. Snow was thawing
    and flocks of wild geese were flying north a month before their wonted
    time. The women of the Goose Society called the people for their spring
    dance, and prayed the gods for good weather for the corn planting. One
    Buffalo sent a crier through the lodges, warning us to make ready to
    break camp. On the day set, we all returned to Like-a-Fishhook village,
    glad to leave our stuffy little winter lodges for our roomy summer
    homes.</p>

  <p>One morning, shortly after our return, my father came into the lodge
    with two brave men, Flying Eagle and Stuck-by-Fish. My grandfather,
    Big Cloud, joined them. Big Cloud lighted a pipe, offered smoke to the
    gods, and passed the pipe to the others. It was a long pipe with black
    stone bowl. The four men talked together. I heard my father speak of a
    war party and that he was sure his gods were strong.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p>

  <p>Toward evening, Red Blossom boiled meat and set it before the men. When
    they had eaten, Small Ankle rose and went to his medicine bag, that
    hung in the rear of the lodge. He held out his hands and I saw his lips
    move; and I knew he was praying. He opened the medicine bag and took
    out a bundle which he unrolled. It was a black bear’s skin, painted
    red. He bore the skin reverently out of the lodge, and came back
    empty-handed. Flying Eagle and Stuck-by-Fish rose and left the lodge.</p>

  <p>My father sat by the fire awhile, silent. Then from a post of his bed
    he fetched his hunting cap. “I shall need this cap,” he said to Red
    Blossom. “See if it must be sewed or mended in any place.”</p>

  <div class="figright illowp53">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_025.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>The next morning when I went out of the lodge, I saw that the
    black-bear skin was bound to one of the posts at the entrance. This was
    a sign that my father was going to lead out a war party. I was almost
    afraid to pass the bear skin, for I knew it was very holy.</p>

  <p>For days after, young men came to our lodge to talk with my father and
    Big Cloud. My mothers—for so I called Red Blossom and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span> Strikes-Many
    Woman—had the pot boiling all the time, to give food to the young
    warriors.</p>

  <p>One night I was in bed and asleep, when I woke with a start, hearing
    low voices. Peeping out, I saw many young men sitting around the
    fireplace. The fire had died down, but the night was clear and a little
    light came through the smoke hole. Many of the young men had bows and
    well-filled quivers on their backs. A few had guns.</p>

  <p>Some one struck flint and steel, and I saw by the glow of the burning
    tobacco that a pipe was being passed. The men were talking low, almost
    in whispers. Then I heard Big Cloud’s voice, low and solemn, praying:
    “Oh gods, keep watch over these our young men. Let none of them be
    harmed. Help them strike many enemies and steal many horses.”</p>

  <p>The company now arose and filed out of the lodge. As the skin door fell
    shut after them, I heard the whinny of Small Ankle’s war pony without.
    Next morning, I learned that Small Ankle and Big Cloud had led out a
    war party, all mounted, to strike the northern Sioux.</p>

  <p>The ice on the Missouri river broke, and ran out with much crashing and
    roaring. Some dead buffaloes, frozen in the ice, came floating down
    the current. Our brave young men, leaping upon the ice cakes, poled
    the carcasses to shore. We were glad to get such carcasses. Buffaloes
    killed in the spring were lean and poor in flesh; but these, frozen in
    the ice, were fat and tender.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

  <p>A good many frozen carcasses were thus taken at the spring break-up.
    In the fall the rivers froze over, often with rather thin ice. A herd
    would come down to the river’s edge and stand lowing and grumbling,
    until some bold bull walked out upon the ice. The whole herd followed,
    often breaking through with their weight.</p>

  <div class="figright illowp50">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_027.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>The weather stayed warm. Bushes in the woods had begun to leaf, and old
    Turtle even raked part of our field and planted sunflower seed around
    the border. “We never saw such an early spring,” said some of the old
    men.</p>

  <p>Then, one night, a cold wind arose with rain turning to snow. I woke
    up, crying out that I was chilled. My grandmother, who slept with me,
    pulled over us an extra robe she had laid up on the top of the bed
    frame.</p>

  <p>The next morning a terrible blizzard broke over our village. The wind
    howled overhead, driving the falling snow in blinding clouds. Red
    Blossom drew her robe over her head and went to the entrance to run
    over to our next neighbor’s; but she came back. “I am afraid to go
    out,” she said. “The air is so full of snow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span> that I can not see my
    hand when I hold it before my face. I fear I might lose my way, and
    wander out on the prairie and die.” There were stories in the tribe of
    villagers who had perished thus.</p>

  <p>Old Turtle and Strikes-Many Woman made ready our noon meal—no easy
    thing to do; for the cold wind, driving down the smoke hole, blew ashes
    into our faces and into our food. An old bull-boat frame was turned
    over the smoke hole. Against it, on the windward side, my mothers had
    laid a buffalo skin the night before, weighting it down with a stone.
    This was to keep the wind from blowing smoke down the smoke hole; but
    the wind had shifted in the night, blowing the buffalo skin off the
    boat frame. The weight of the stone had sunk one end of the skin into
    the earth roof, where it had frozen fast; and we could hear the loose
    end flapping and beating in the wind. Little snow came down the smoke
    hole. The wind was so strong that it carried the snow off the roof.</p>

  <p>Turtle and Strikes-Many Woman had gone with dogs for firewood only the
    day before; so there was plenty of fuel in the lodge. We could not go
    to get water at the river; but Red Blossom crept into the entrance way
    and filled a skin basket with snow. This she melted in a clay pot, for
    water. It was in this water that we boiled our meat for the midday
    meal. In spite of the calf skin that my grandmother belted about me,
    I shivered with the cold until my teeth chattered. Turtle poured some
    of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span> meat broth, steaming hot, into a wooden bowl, and fetched me
    a buffalo-horn spoon. With this spoon I scooped up the broth, glad to
    swallow something hot into my cold little stomach.</p>

  <p>After our meal, my two mothers and Turtle sat on my father’s couch,
    looking grave. “I hope Small Ankle and Big Cloud have reached shelter
    in the Missouri-river timber,” I heard Red Blossom say. “If they are on
    the prairie in this storm, they will die.”</p>

  <p>“Big Cloud’s prayers are strong,” answered Turtle, “and Small Ankle is
    a good plainsman. I am sure they and their party will find shelter.”</p>

  <p>“I knew a Mandan who was caught in a blizzard,” said Red Blossom. “He
    walked with the wind until he fell into a coulee, that was full of
    snow. He burrowed under the drifts and lay on his back, with his knees
    doubled against his chin and his robe tight about him. He lay there
    three days, until the storm blew over. He had a little parched corn for
    food; and, for drink, he ate snow. He came home safely; but his mouth
    was sore from the snow he had eaten.”</p>

  <p>Darkness came early, with the wind still screaming overhead. Turtle
    tried to parch some corn in a clay pot, but blasts from the smoke hole
    blew ashes into her eyes. She took out a handful of the half-parched
    corn, when it had cooled, and poured it into my two hands. This was my
    supper; but she also gave me a lump of dried chokecherries to eat. They
    were sweet and I was fond of them.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span></p>

  <p>I awoke the next morning to see my mothers cooking our breakfast,
    parched-corn meal stirred into a thick mush with beans and marrow fat.
    I sprang out of bed and glanced up at the smoke hole. The sky, I saw,
    was clear and the sun was shining.</p>

  <p>The second day after, about midafternoon, Small Ankle came home. I
    heard the tinkle of the hollow hoofs that hung on the skin door, and in
    a moment my father came around the fire screen leading his war pony, a
    bay with a white nose. He put his pony in the corral, replaced the bar,
    and came over to his couch by the fire. My mothers said nothing. Red
    Blossom put water and dried meat in a pot and set it on the fire, and
    Turtle fetched an armful of green cottonwood bark to feed the pony.</p>

  <p>My father took off his big cap and hung it on the drying pole, and
    wrung out his moccasins and hung them beside the cap. They were winter
    moccasins, and in each was a kind of stocking, of buffalo skin turned
    fur in, and cut and sewed to fit snugly over the foot. These stockings
    Small Ankle drew out and laid by the fire, to dry. He put on dry
    moccasins, threw off his robe, and took upon his knees the bowl of
    broth and meat that Red Blossom silently handed him.</p>

  <p>In the evening, some of his cronies came in to smoke and talk. Small
    Ankle told them of his war party.</p>

  <p>“We had a hard time,” he said. “Perhaps the gods, for some cause, were
    angry with us. We had gone five days; evening came and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span> began to
    rain. We were on the prairie, and our young men sat all night with
    their saddles and saddle skins over their heads to keep off the rain.</p>

  <p>“In the morning, the rain turned to snow. A heavy wind blew the snow in
    our faces, nearly blinding us.</p>

  <div class="figright illowp55">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_031.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>“‘We must make our way to the Missouri timber and find shelter,’ Big
    Cloud said.</p>

  <p>“Flying Eagle feared we could not find our way. ‘The air is so full of
    snow that we can not see the hills,’ he said.</p>

  <p>“‘The wind will guide us,’ said Stuck-by-Fish. ‘We know the Missouri
    river is in the south. The wind is from the west. If we travel with the
    wind on our right, we shall be headed south. We should reach the river
    before night.’</p>

  <p>“I thought this a good plan, and I cried, ‘My young men, saddle your
    horses.’ We had flat saddles, such as hunters use. We had a few bundles
    of dried meat left. These we bound firmly to our saddles, for we knew
    we could kill no game while the storm lasted.</p>

  <p>“Many of my young men had head cloths which they bound over their hair
    and under their chins; but the wind was so strong that it blew the wet
    snow through the cloths, freezing them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span> to the men’s faces. I had on my
    fur cap, which kept my face warm. Also, I think the jack-rabbit spirits
    helped me.</p>

  <p>“We pushed on; but the snow got deeper and deeper until we could hardly
    force our ponies through it. We grew so chilled that Big Cloud ordered
    us to dismount and go afoot. ‘You go first,’ he said to Flying Eagle.
    ‘You are a tall man and have long legs. You break the way through the
    snow. We will follow single-file.’</p>

  <p>“Flying Eagle did so, leading his pony. With Flying Eagle had come his
    brother, Short Buffalo, a lad of fourteen or fifteen years. He was not
    yet grown, and his legs were so short that he could not make his way
    through the deep snow. We let him ride.</p>

  <p>“But in a little while Short Buffalo cried out, ‘My brother, I freeze;
    I die!’</p>

  <p>“Flying Eagle called back, ‘Do not give up, little brother. Be strong!’
    And he came back and bound Short Buffalo’s robe snugly about his neck,
    and took the reins of his pony, so that Short Buffalo could draw his
    hands under his robe to warm them. Short Buffalo’s robe had frozen
    stiff in the cold wind.</p>

  <p>“We reached the Missouri before nightfall and went down into the thick
    timber. It was good to be out of the freezing wind, sheltered by the
    trees.</p>

  <p>“Flying Eagle led us to a point of land over which had swept a fire,
    killing the trees. Many dead cottonwoods stood there, with shaggy bark.
    We peeled off the thick outer bark, shredding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span> the dry inner bark
    for tinder. I had flint and steel. We rolled over a fallen trunk and
    started a fire on the dry ground beneath. We broke off dead branches
    for fuel.</p>

  <p>“Flying Eagle helped me get wood and start the fire. He is a strong
    man and bore the cold better than the others. Many of the men were too
    benumbed to help any. My mittens and my cap had kept me warm.</p>

  <p>“The men’s leggings, wetted by rain and snow, were frozen stiff. We
    soon had a hot fire. When their leggings had thawed soft, the men took
    off these and their moccasins, and wrung them out; and when they had
    half dried them by the fire, put them on again. They also put shredded
    cottonwood bark in their moccasins, packing it about their feet and
    ankles to keep them warm and dry.</p>

  <p>“We toasted dried meat over the fire, and ate; for we were hungry, and
    weak from the cold. We fed our ponies green cottonwood branches that we
    cut with our knives.</p>

  <p>“The storm died down before morning; and early the next day we started
    down the river to our village. We were slow coming, for the snow
    thawed, growing soft and slushy under our ponies’ feet. Our ponies,
    too, were weak from the cold.”</p>

  <p>Many of the young men of my father’s party had their faces frozen on
    the right side. Short Buffalo had part of his right hand frozen, and
    his right foot. He was sick for a long time. Another war party that had
    been led<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span> out by Wooden House had also been caught in the storm and had
    fared even worse. They were afoot, and, not being able to reach the
    river timber, they lay down in a coulee and let the snow drift over
    them. Two were frozen to death.</p>

  <p>The leaders of a war party were held to blame for any harm that came
    to their men. The villagers, however, did not blame my father much.
    Some of the older men said, “Small Ankle and Big Cloud were foolish.
    The wild geese had come north, but this fact alone was not proof that
    winter had gone. We know that bad storms often blow up at this season
    of the year.”</p>

  <p>Of course, being but six years old, I could hardly remember all these
    things. But my father talked of his war party many times afterwards, at
    his evening fire, as he smoked with his cronies; and so I came to know
    the story.</p>

  </div>

  <p>My good old grandmother could be stern when I was naughty;
    nevertheless, I loved her dearly, and I know she was fond of me. After
    the death of my mother, it fell to Turtle to care for me much of the
    time. There were other children in the household, and, with so many
    mouths to feed, my two other mothers, as I called them, had plenty of
    work to do.</p>

  <p>Indians are great story tellers; especially are they fond of telling
    tales around the lodge fire in the long evenings of autumn and winter.
    My father and his cronies used sometimes to sit up all night, drumming
    and singing and telling stories. Young men often came with gift of robe
    or knife, to ask him to tell them tales of our tribe.</p>

  <p>I was too young yet to understand many of these tales. My father was
    hours telling some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span> of them, and they had many strange words. But my
    grandmother used to tell me stories as she sat or worked by the lodge
    fire.</p>

  <div class="figleft illowp50">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_036.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>One evening in the corn planting moon, she was making ready her seed
    for the morrow’s planting. She had a string of braided ears lying
    beside her. Of these ears she chose the best, broke off the tip and
    butt of each, and shelled the perfect grain of the mid-cob into a
    wooden bowl. Baby-like, I ran my fingers through the shiny grain,
    spilling a few kernels on the floor.</p>

  <p>“Do not do that,” cried my grandmother. “Corn is sacred; if you waste
    it, the gods will be angry.”</p>

  <p>I still drew my fingers through the smooth grain, and my grandmother
    continued: “Once a Ree woman went out to gather her corn. She tied her
    robe about her with a big fold in the front, like a pocket. Into this
    she dropped the ears that she plucked, and bore them off to the husking
    pile. All over the field she went, row by row, leaving not an ear.</p>

  <p>“She was starting off with her last load when she heard a weak voice,
    like a babe’s, calling, ‘Please, please do not go. Do not leave me.’</p>

  <p>“The woman stopped, astonished. She put down her load. ‘Can there be a
    babe hidden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span> in the corn?’ she thought. She then carefully searched the
    field, hill by hill, but found nothing.</p>

  <p>“She was taking up her load, when again she heard the voice: ‘Oh,
    please do not go. Do not leave me!’ Again she searched, but found
    nothing.</p>

  <p>“She was lifting her load when the voice came the third time: ‘Please,
    please, do not go! Please, do not leave me!’</p>

  <p>“This time the woman searched every corn hill, lifting every leaf. And
    lo, in one corner of the field, hidden under a leaf, she found a tiny
    nubbin of yellow corn. It was the nubbin that had been calling to her.
    For so the gods would teach us not to be wasteful of their gifts.”</p>

  <p>Another evening I was trying to parch an ear of corn over the coals of
    our lodge fire. I had stuck the ear on the end of a squash spit, as I
    had seen my mothers do; but my baby fingers were not strong enough to
    fix the ear firmly, and it fell off into the coals and began to burn.
    My mouth puckered, and I was ready to cry.</p>

  <p>My grandmother laughed. “You should put only half the ear on the spit,”
    she said. “That is the way the Mandans did when they first gave us
    corn.”</p>

  <p>I dropped the spit and, forgetting the burning ear, asked eagerly, “How
    did the Mandans give us corn, grandmother? Tell me the story.”</p>

  <p>Turtle picked up the spit and raked the burning ear from the ashes.
    “I have told you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span> that the gods gave us corn to eat, not to waste,”
    she said. “Some of the kernels on this cob are well parched.” And she
    shelled off a handful and put one of the hot kernels in her mouth.</p>

  <p>“I will tell you the story,” she continued. “I had it from my mother
    when I was a little girl like you.</p>

  <p>“In the beginning, our Hidatsa people lived under the waters of Devils
    Lake. They had earth lodges and lived much as we live now. One day
    some hunters found the root of a grapevine growing down from the lake
    overhead. They climbed the vine and found themselves on this earth.
    Others climbed the vine until half the tribe had escaped; but, when a
    fat woman tried to climb it, the vine broke, leaving the rest of the
    tribe under the lake.</p>

  <p>“Those who had safely climbed the vine, built villages of earth lodges.
    They lived by hunting; and some very old men say that they also planted
    small fields in ground beans and wild potatoes. As yet the Hidatsas
    knew nothing of corn or squashes.</p>

  <p>“One day, a war party that had wandered west to the Missouri river saw
    on the other side a village of earth lodges like their own. It was a
    village of the Mandans. Neither they nor the Hidatsas would cross over,
    each party fearing the other might be enemies.</p>

  <p>“It was in the fall of the year, and the Missouri was running low, so
    that an arrow could be shot from shore to shore. The Mandans parched
    some ears of ripe corn with the grain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span> on the cob. These ears they
    broke in pieces, stuck the pieces on the points of arrows and shot them
    across the river. ‘Eat!’ they called. The word for ‘eat’ is the same in
    both the Hidatsa and the Mandan languages.</p>

  <p>“The Hidatsas ate of the parched corn. They returned to their village
    and said, ‘We have found a people on a great river, to the west. They
    have a strange kind of grain. We ate of it and found it good.’</p>

  <p>“After this, a party of Hidatsas went to visit the Mandans. The Mandan
    chief took an ear of corn, broke it in two, and gave half to the
    Hidatsas for seed. This half ear the Hidatsas took home, and soon every
    family in the village was planting corn.”</p>

  <p>My father had been listening, as he sat smoking on the other side of
    the fire. “I know that story,” he said. “The name of the Mandan chief
    was Good-Fur Robe.”</p>

  <p>My grandmother then put me to bed. I was so sleepy that I did not
    notice she had eaten up all the corn I had parched.</p>

  <p>Winter came again, and spring. As soon as the soil could be worked,
    my mothers and old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span> Turtle began cleaning up our field, and breaking
    new ground to add to it. Our first year’s field had been small; but my
    mothers added to it each season, until the field was as large as our
    family needed.</p>

  <p>I was too little to note very much of what was done. I remember that my
    father set up boundary marks—little piles of earth or stones, I think
    they were—to mark the corners of the field we claimed. My mothers and
    Turtle began at one end of the field and worked forward. My mothers had
    their heavy iron hoes; and Turtle, her old-fashioned digging stick.</p>

  <p>On the new ground, my mothers first cut the long grass with their hoes,
    bearing it off the field to be burned. They next dug and loosened the
    soil in places for the corn hills, which they laid off in rows. These
    hills they planted. Then all summer in this and other parts of the
    field they worked with their hoes, breaking and loosening the soil
    between the corn hills and cutting weeds.</p>

  <p>Small trees and bushes, I know, were cut off with axes; but I remember
    little of this labor, most of it having been done the year before, when
    I was yet quite small. My father once told me that in very old times,
    when the women cleared a field, they first dug the corn hills with
    digging sticks, and afterwards worked between them with their bone hoes.</p>

  <p>I remember this season’s work the better for a dispute that my mothers
    had with two neighbors, Lone Woman and Goes-Back-to-Next-Timber.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span> These
    two women were clearing lands that bordered our own. My father, I
    have said, to set up claim to our land, had placed boundary marks,
    one of them in the corner that touched the fields of Lone Woman and
    Goes-Back-to-Next-Timber. While my mothers were busy clearing and
    digging up the other end of their field, their two neighbors invaded
    this marked-off corner. Lone Woman had even dug up a small part before
    she was discovered.</p>

  <p>My mothers showed Lone Woman the mark my father had placed.
    “This land belongs to us,” they said; “but we will pay you and
    Goes-Back-to-Next-Timber for any rights you may think are yours. We do
    not want our neighbors to bear us any hard feelings.”</p>

  <p>We Indians thought our fields sacred, and we did not like to quarrel
    about them. A family’s right to a field once having been set up, no one
    thought of disputing it. If any one tried to seize land belonging to
    another, we thought some evil would come upon him; as that one of his
    family would die or have some bad sickness.</p>

  <p>There is a story of a hunter who had before been a black bear, and had
    been given great magic power. He dared try to catch eagles from another
    man’s pit, and had his mind taken from him for doing so. Thus the gods
    punished him for entering ground that was not his own.</p>

  <p>Lone Woman and Goes-Back-to-Next-Timber having withdrawn, my
    grandmother Turtle undertook to clear and break the ground that had
    been in dispute. She was a little woman but active,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span> and she loved to
    work out-of-doors. Often, when my mothers were busy in the earth lodge,
    Turtle would go out to work in the field, and she would take me along
    for company. I was too little to help her any, but I liked to watch her
    work.</p>

  <div class="figleft illowp45">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_042.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>With her digging stick Turtle dug up a little round place in the center
    of the corner, and around this she circled from day to day, enlarging
    the dug-up space. She had folded her robe over her middle, like a
    pad. Resting the handle of her digging stick against her folded robe,
    she would drive the point into the soft earth to a depth equal to the
    length of my hand and pry up the soil.</p>

  <p>She broke clods by striking them smartly with her digging stick. Roots
    of coarse grass, weeds, small brush and the like, she took in her hand
    and shook or struck them against the ground, to knock off the loose
    earth clinging to them. She then cast them into little piles to dry. In
    a few days she gathered these piles into a heap about four feet high
    and burned them.</p>

  <p>My grandmother worked in this way all summer, but not always in the
    corner that had been in dispute. Some days, I remember, she dug along
    the edges of the field, to add to it and make the edges even. Of
    course, not all the labor of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span> enlarging the field was done by Turtle;
    but she liked to have me with her when she worked, and I remember best
    what I saw her do.</p>

  <p>It was my grandmother’s habit to rise early in the summer months.
    She often arrived at the field before sunrise; about ten o’clock she
    returned to the lodge to eat and rest.</p>

  <p>One morning, having come to the field quite early, I grew tired of my
    play before my grandmother had ended her work. “I want to go home,”
    I begged, and I began to cry. Just then a strange bird flew into the
    field. It had a long curved beak, and made a queer cry, <i>cur-lew,
    cur-lew</i>.</p>

  <p>I stopped weeping. My grandmother laughed.</p>

  <p>“That is a curlew,” she said. “Once at the mouth of the Knife river, a
    woman went out with her digging stick to dig wild turnips. The woman
    had a babe. Growing tired of carrying her babe on her back, she laid it
    on the ground.</p>

  <p>“The babe began to cry. The mother was busy digging turnips, and did
    not go to her babe as she should have done. By and by she looked up.
    Her babe was flying away as a bird!</p>

  <p>“The bird was a curlew, that cries like a babe. Now, if you cry,
    perhaps you, too, will turn into a curlew.”</p>

    <div class="large mt2">FIFTH CHAPTER</div>
    <h2 class="nobreak">LIFE IN AN EARTH LODGE</h2>
  </div>

  <p>The small lodges we built for winter did not stand long after we left
    them in the spring. Built on low ground by the Missouri, they were
    often swept away in the June rise; for in that month the river is
    flooded by snows melting in the Rocky Mountains.</p>

  <p>The loss of our winter lodges never troubled us, however; for we
    thought of them as but huts. Then, too, we seldom wintered twice in the
    same place. We burned much firewood in our winter lodges, and before
    spring came the women had to go far to find it. The next season we made
    camp in a new place, where was plenty of dead-and-down wood for fuel.</p>

  <p>We looked upon our summer lodges, to which we came every spring, as our
    real homes. There were about seventy of these, earth lodges<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span> well-built
    and roomy, in Like-a-Fishhook village. Most of them were built the
    second summer of our stay there.</p>

  <p>My mothers’ earth lodge—for the lodge belonged to the women of a
    household—was a large one, with floor measuring more than forty feet
    across. In the center was the fireplace. A screen of puncheons, set
    upright in a trench, stood between the fireplace and the door. This
    screen shut out draughts and kept out the dogs.</p>

  <p>The screen ran quite to the sloping wall, on the right; but, on
    the left, there was space for a passage from the door to the fire.
    Right and left in an Indian lodge are reckoned as one stands at the
    fireplace, looking toward the door. We thought an earth lodge was alive
    and had a spirit like a human body, and that its front was like a face,
    with the door for mouth.</p>

  <div class="figright illowp55">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_045.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>Before the fireplace and against the puncheon screen was my father’s
    bed. Forked posts, eighteen inches high, stood in the earth floor. On
    poles laid in the forks rested cottonwood planks over which were thrown
    buffalo robes. A skin pillow, stuffed with antelope hair, lay at one
    end of the bed.</p>

  <p>The beds of the rest of the family stood in the back of the lodge,
    against the wall. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span> were less simply made than my father’s, being
    each covered with an old tent skin drawn over a frame of posts and
    poles. The bedding was of buffalo skins. As these could not be washed,
    my mothers used to take them out and hang them on the poles of the corn
    stage on sunny days, to air.</p>

  <div class="figleft illowp53">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_046.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>Most of the earth lodges—at least most of the larger ones—had each a
    bed like my father’s before the fireplace; for this was the warmest
    place in the lodge. Usually the eldest in the family, as the father or
    grandfather, slept in this bed.</p>

  <p>My father’s bed, not being enclosed, made a good lounging place by day,
    and here he sat to smoke or chat with his friends. My mothers, too,
    used to sit here to peel wild turnips or make ready the daily meals.</p>

  <p>Two or three sticks burned in the fireplace, not piled one upon the
    other as done by white men, but laid with ends meeting. As the ends
    burned away, the sticks were pushed in, keeping alive a small but hot
    fire. At night, the last thing my father did was to cover one of these
    burning sticks with ashes, that it might keep fire until morning.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span></p>

  <p>Unless he had spent the night with some of his cronies, my father was
    the first to rise in the morning. He would go to the fireplace, draw
    out a buried coal, lay some dry sticks upon it, and blow with his
    breath until the fire caught. Sometimes he fanned the coal with a goose
    wing.</p>

  <p>Soon a little column of smoke would rise toward the smoke hole, and my
    father would call, “Up, little daughter; up, sons! Get up, wives! The
    sun is up. To the river for your bath! Hasten!” And he would go up on
    the roof to look if enemies were about and if his horses were safe. My
    mothers were already up when I crept from my bed still sleepy, but glad
    that morning had come.</p>

  <div class="figright illowp41">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_047.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>But if the weather was cold, we did not go to the river to bathe. An
    earthen pot full of water stood by one of the posts near the fire. It
    rested in a ring of bark, to keep it from falling. My mothers dipped
    each a big horn spoon full of water, filled her mouth, and, blowing the
    water over her palms, gave her face a good rubbing. Red Blossom washed
    my face in the same way. I did not like it very much, and I would shut
    my eyes and pucker my face when I felt the cold water. Red Blossom
    would say, “Why do you pucker up your face? You make it look like a
    piece of old, dried, buffalo skin.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>

  <div class="figleft illowp50">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_048.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>Her face washed, Red Blossom sat on the edge of her bed and finished
    her toilet. She had a little fawn-skin bag, worked with red porcupine
    quills. From this bag she took her hairbrush, a porcupine tail mounted
    on a stick, with the sharp points of the quills cut off. She brushed
    her hair smooth, parting it in two braids that fell over each shoulder
    nearly hiding her ears. Red Blossom was no longer young, but her black
    tresses had not a grey hair in them.</p>

  <p>She now opened her paint bag, put a little buffalo grease on her two
    fingers, pressed the tips lightly in the dry paint, and rubbed them
    over her cheeks and face. She also rubbed a little red into the part of
    her hair.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the pot had been put on the fire. We Indians did not eat
    many things at a meal as white men do. Usually, breakfast was of one
    thing, often buffalo meat dried, and boiled to soften it. When a
    buffalo was killed, the meat was cut into thin slices, and some parts,
    into strips. These were dried in the open air over the earth lodge fire
    or in the smoke of a small fire out-of-doors. For breakfast, a round
    earthen pot was filled with water, dried meat put in, and the water
    brought to a boil. Red Blossom used to lift out the hot meat slices on
    the point of a stick, laying them on a bit of clean rawhide.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>

  <p>A rough bench stood back of the fireplace, a cottonwood plank, with
    ends resting on two blocks chopped from a tree trunk. My grandmother
    Turtle sat on this bench to eat her meals. My two mothers sat beside
    her, or on the floor near the meat they were serving. My father ate
    sitting on the edge of his couch. A wooden bowl, heaped with steaming
    meat, was set before each. Our fingers did for forks.</p>

  <p>Boiling the meat in water made a thin broth which we used for a hot
    drink. It was very good, tasting much like white man’s beef tea. We had
    no cups; but we had big spoons made of buffalo horn, and ladles, of
    mountain-sheep horn. Either of these did very well for drinking cups.
    Sometimes we used mussel shells.</p>

  <p>A common breakfast dish was <i>mapee<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> naka-pah</i>,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> or
    pounded-meal mush. From her cache pit Red Blossom took a string of
    dried squash slices. She cut off a length and tied the ends together,
    making a ring four or five inches in width. This ring and a double
    handful of beans she dropped in a pot of water, and set on the fire.
    When boiled, she lifted the ring out with a stick, with her horn ladle
    mashed the softened squash slices in a wooden bowl and put them back in
    the pot.</p>

  <div class="center">
    <div class="inline">
      <div class="footnotel">
        <a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5">[5]</a> mä pēē´

      <div class="footnotel">
        <a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6">[6]</a> nä kä päh´
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Meanwhile Strikes-Many Woman or old Turtle had parched some corn in a
    clay pot, and toasted some buffalo fats on a stick, over the coals. Red
    Blossom now pounded the parched corn and toasted fats together in the
    corn mortar, and stirred the pounded mass into the pot with <span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>the squash
    and beans. The mess was soon done. Red Blossom dipped it into our bowls
    with a horn spoon.</p>

  <div class="figleft illowp47">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_050.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>We ate such messes with horn spoons or with mussel shells; for we
    Hidatsas had few metal spoons in those days. There was a shelf, or
    bench, at one side of the room, under the sloping roof, where were
    stored wooden bowls, uneaten foods, horn spoons, and the mussel shells
    that we used for teaspoons. When I was a little girl, nearly every
    family owned such shells, worn smooth and shiny from use.</p>

  <p>After breakfast, unless it was in the corn season, when they went to
    the field, my mothers tidied up the lodge. They had short brooms of
    buckbrush. With these they swept the floor, stooping over and drawing
    the broom with a sidewise motion. As my father stabled his hunting
    ponies in the lodge at night, there was a good deal of litter to be
    taken out. Red Blossom used to scrape her sweepings into a skin basket,
    which she bore to the river bank and emptied.</p>

  <p>Other tasks were then taken up; and there were plenty of them.
    Moccasins had to be made or old ones mended. Shirts and other garments
    had to be made. Often there were skins to be dressed or scraped.
    Leggings and shirts were embroidered usually in winter, when the women
    had no corn to hoe.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

  <p>There was a good deal of visiting in our lodge; for my father was one
    of the chiefs of the village, and always kept open house. “If a man
    would be chief,” we said, “he should be ready to feed the poor and
    strangers.” A pot with buffalo meat or corn and beans cooking was
    always on the fire in my father’s lodge. His friends and the other
    chief men of the village often came in to talk over affairs. A visitor
    came in without knocking, but did not sit down until he was asked.</p>

  <p>Friends of my mothers also came in to sit and chat; and they often
    joined my mothers at whatever task they might be doing. Red Blossom
    would set a bowl of food before each. What she could not eat the guest
    took home with her. It was impolite to leave any uneaten food, as that
    would mean, “I do not like your cooking; it is unfit to eat.”</p>

  <p>My mothers were neat housekeepers and kept the ground about the lodge
    entrance swept as clean as the lodge floor; but many families were
    careless, and cast ashes, floor sweepings, scraps of broken bones and
    other litter on the ground about their lodges. In time this rubbish
    made little piles and became a nuisance, so that people could hardly
    walk in the paths between the lodges.</p>

  <p>The Black Mouths then went through the village and ordered the women to
    clean up. The Black Mouths were a society of men of about forty years
    of age. They acted as police and punished any one who broke the camp
    laws.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>

  <p>These clean-ups were made rather often; in summer, perhaps twice a
    month. They were always ordered by the Black Mouths.</p>

  <div class="figleft illowp38">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_052.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>I remember one morning, just after breakfast, I heard singing, as of a
    dozen or more men coming toward our lodge. I started to run out to see
    what it was, but my mothers cried, “Do not go. It is the Black Mouths.”
    My mothers, I thought, looked rather scared. We were still speaking,
    when I heard the tramp of feet. The door lifted, and the Black Mouths
    came in.</p>

  <p>They looked very terrible, all painted with the lower half of the face
    black. Many, but not all, had the upper half of the face red. Some had
    eagles’ feathers in their hair, and all wore robes or blankets. Some
    carried guns. Others had sticks about as long as my arm. With these
    sticks they beat any woman who would not help in the clean-up.</p>

  <p>I fled to my father, but I dared not cry out, for I, too, was scared.</p>

  <p>“One of you women go out and help clean up the village,” said the Black
    Mouths. They spoke sternly, and several of them at once.</p>

  <p>Like all the other women, my mothers were afraid of the Black Mouths
    “We will go,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span> said both, and Red Blossom caught up broom and skin
    basket and went out.</p>

  <p>The Black Mouths went also, and I followed to see what they did. They
    went into another lodge not far away. I heard voices, then the report
    of a gun, and a woman screamed. After a time, the Black Mouths came out
    driving before them a woman, very angry, but much frightened. She had
    not moved quickly enough to get her basket, and one of the Black Mouths
    had fired his gun at her feet to frighten her. The gun was loaded only
    with powder.</p>

  <p>After they had made the rounds of the village, the Black Mouths
    returned to the lodge of their “keeper,” a man named Crow Paunch. Soon
    we heard singing and drumming, and knew they were singing some of the
    society’s songs.</p>

  <p>When they had sung three or four times, there was silence for a while,
    as if a pipe were being passed. Then all came out and made the rounds
    a second time, to see if the work of cleaning was done and to hurry up
    the laggards. The village was all cleaned before noon; but some of the
    women got their work done sooner than others.</p>

  <p>After the clean-up the village children came out to play in the spaces
    between the lodges, now swept clean and smooth. It was in these smooth
    spaces that the boys liked to play at throw sticks, light willow rods
    which they darted against the ground, whence they bounded to a great
    distance.</p>

    <div class="large mt2">SIXTH CHAPTER</div>
    <h2 class="nobreak">CHILDHOOD GAMES AND BELIEFS</h2>
  </div>

  <p>White people seem to think that Indian children never have any play
    and never laugh. Such ideas seem very funny to me. How can any child
    grow up without play? I have seen children at our reservation school
    playing white men’s games—baseball, prisoners’ base, marbles. We Indian
    children also had games. I think they were better than white children’s
    games.</p>

  <p>I look back upon my girlhood as the happiest time of my life. How I
    should like to see all my little girl playmates again! Some still live,
    and when we meet at feasts or at Fourth-of-July camp, we talk of the
    good times we had when we were children.</p>

  <p>My little half sister was my usual playmate. She was two years younger
    than I, and I loved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span> her dearly. She had a pretty name, Cold Medicine.
    On our prairies grows a flower with long, yellow root. In old times, if
    a warrior was running from enemies and became wearied he chewed a bit
    of the root and rubbed it on his eyelids. It made his eyes and tongue
    feel cold and kept him awake. The flower for this reason was called
    cold medicine. When my father spoke my sister’s name, it made him think
    of this flower and of the many times he had bravely gone out with war
    parties.</p>

  <div class="figright illowp60">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_055.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>For playgrounds my little sister and I had the level spaces between
    the lodges or the ground under the corn stage, in sunny weather; and
    the big, roomy floor of the earth lodge, if it rained or the weather
    were chill. We liked, too, to play in the lodge in the hot days of the
    Cherry moon; for it was cool inside, never hot and stuffy like a white
    man’s house. In the fall, when the air was frosty, the sun often shone,
    and we could play in the big yellow sunspot that fell on the floor
    through the smoke hole.</p>

  <p>We liked to play at housekeeping, especially in the warm spring
    days, when we had returned from winter camp and could again play
    out-ofdoors.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span> With the help of the neighbors’ children, we fetched long
    forked sticks. These we stacked like a tepee frame and covered with
    robes that we borrowed. To this play tent we brought foods and had a
    feast.</p>

  <p>Sometimes little boys joined in our play; and then it was like real
    housekeeping. We girls chose each a little boy for husband. To my
    little husband I said, “Old man, get your arrows, and go kill some
    buffaloes. We are hungry. Go at once!”</p>

  <p>My little husband hastened to his mother and told her our needs. She
    laughed and gave him a boiled buffalo tongue; or perhaps pemmican,
    dried meat pounded fine and mixed with marrow fat. This and the foods
    which the other little husbands fetched us, we girls laid on fresh,
    clean grass that we pulled. Then we sat down to feast, the little girls
    on one side of the fireplace, the little boys on the other, just as we
    had seen men and women sit when they feasted. Only there really was no
    fireplace. We just made believe there was.</p>

  <p>In summer, my little sister and I often went to the river for wet clay,
    which we modeled into figures. There is a smooth, blue clay found in
    places at the water’s edge, very good for modeling. We liked best to
    make human figures, man, woman, or little child. We dried them in the
    shade, else the sun cracked them. I fear they were not very beautiful.
    When we made a mud man, we had to give him three legs to make him stand
    up.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span></p>

  <p>I had a doll, woven of rushes, that Turtle made me. It really was not
    a doll, but a cradle, such as Indian women used for carrying a small
    child. In winter I had my deer-skin doll, with the beads for eyes.
    My grandmother had made me a little bed for my dolls. The frame was
    of willows, and it was covered with gopher skins, tanned and sewed
    together. In this little bed my sister and I used to put our dollies to
    sleep.</p>

  <div class="figright illowp47">

  <p>We had a game of ball much like shinny. It was a woman’s game, but we
    little girls played it with hooked sticks. We also had a big, soft
    ball, stuffed with antelope hair, which we would bounce in the air with
    the foot. The game was to see how long a girl could bounce the ball
    without letting it touch the ground. Some girls could bounce it more
    than a hundred times. It was lots of fun.</p>

  <p>We coasted in winter, on small sleds made of buffalo ribs; but coasting
    on the snow was rather for boys and older girls. There was another
    kind of coaster that we girls liked. A buffalo skin has the hair lying
    backwards, towards the flanks. I would borrow a skin of my mothers and
    tie a thong through two of the stake holes at the head or neck, to
    draw it by. Such a skin made a good coaster even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span> in summer on a steep
    hillside; for, laid head forward, it slid smoothly over the soft grass.</p>

  <div class="figleft illowp55">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_058.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>Girls of thirteen or fourteen were fond of playing at “tossing in a
    blanket,” or “foot-moving,” as we called it. There were fifteen or
    twenty players. A newly dried skin was borrowed, one that was scraped
    clean of hair. There were always holes cut in the edges of a hide, to
    stake it to the ground while drying. Into each hole a small hard wood
    stick was now thrust and twisted around, for a handle.</p>

  <p>Along the ditch at the edge of the village grew many tall weeds. The
    players pulled armfuls of these and made them into a pile. They laid
    the hide on this pile of weeds; and, with a player at every one of the
    stick handles, they stretched the hide taut.</p>

  <p>A girl now lay downward on the hide. With a quick pull, the others
    tossed her into the air, when she was expected to come down on her
    feet, to be instantly tossed again. The game was to see how many times
    she could be tossed without falling. A player was often tossed ten or
    more times before she lost her balance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span> Each time, as she came down,
    she kept turning in one direction, right or left. When at last she
    fell, the pile of weeds saved her from any hurt.</p>

  <p>We called the game <i>eetseepadahpakee</i>,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> or foot-moving, from the
    player’s habit of wriggling her feet when in the air. We thought this
    wriggling, or foot moving, a mark of skill.</p>

  <p>But, if my mothers let me play much of the time, they did not forget to
    teach me good morals. “We are a family that has not a bad woman in it,”
    they used to say. “You must try hard not to be naughty.”</p>

  <p>My grandfather Big Cloud often talked to me. “My granddaughter,” he
    would say, “try to be good, so that you will grow up to be a good
    woman. Do not quarrel nor steal. Do not answer anyone with bad words.
    Obey your parents, and remember all that I say.”</p>

  <div class="figright illowp40">

  </div>

  <p>When I was naughty my mothers usually scolded me; for they were kind
    women and did not like to have me punished. Sometimes they scared me
    into being good, by saying, “The owl will get you.” This saying had to
    do with an old custom that I will explain.</p>

  <p>Until I was about nine years old, my hair was cut short, with a tuft on
    either side of my head, like the horns of an owl. Turtle used to cut my
    hair. She used a big, steel knife. In old times, I have heard, a thin
    blade of flint was <span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>used. I did not like Turtle’s hair cutting a bit,
    because she <i>pulled</i>.</p>

  <p>“Why do you cut my hair, grandmother?” I asked.</p>

  <p>“It is our custom,” Turtle answered. “I will tell you the story.”</p>

  <p>“Thousands and thousands of years ago, there lived a great owl. He was
    strong and had magic power, but he was a bad bird. When the hunters
    killed buffaloes, the owl would turn all the meat bitter, so that the
    Indians could not eat it, and so they were always hungry.</p>

  <p>“On this earth then lived a young man called the Sun’s Child; for the
    sun was his father. He heard how the Indians were made hungry, and came
    to help them.</p>

  <p>“The owl lived in a hollow tree that had a hole high up in its trunk.
    The Sun’s Child climbed the tree, and when the owl put his head out of
    the hole, he caught the bird by the neck.</p>

  <p>“‘Do not let the Sun’s Child kill me!’ the owl cried to the Indians. ‘I
    have been a bad bird; now I will be good and I will help your children.</p>

  <p>“‘As soon as a child is old enough to understand you when you speak to
    him, cut his hair with two tufts like my own. Do this to make him look
    like an owl; and I will remember and make the child grow up strong and
    healthy. If a child weeps or will not obey, say to him, “The owl will
    get you!” This will frighten him, so that he will obey you.’”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span></p>

  <p>It was thus my mothers frightened me when I was naughty. Red Blossom
    would call, “O owl, I have a bad daughter. Come.”</p>

  <p>“I will be good, I will be good!” I would cry, as I ran to my father. I
    knew he would not let the owl hurt me.</p>

  <p>My old grandfather, Missouri River, taught me of the gods. He was a
    medicine man and very holy, and I was rather afraid of him. He used
    to sit on the bench behind the fire, to smoke. He had a long pipe, of
    polished black stone. He liked best to smoke dried tobacco blossoms
    which he first oiled with buffalo fat.</p>

  <div class="figright illowp56">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_063.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>One day, as he sat smoking, I asked him, “Grandfather, who are the
    gods?”</p>

  <p>Missouri River took a long pull at his pipe, blew the smoke from his
    nostrils, and put the stem from his mouth. “Little granddaughter,” he
    answered, “this earth is alive and has a soul or spirit, just as you
    have a spirit. Other things also have spirits, the sun, clouds, trees,
    beasts, birds. These spirits are our gods. We pray to them and offer
    them food, that they may help us when we have need.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span></p>

  <p>“Do the spirits eat the food?” I asked. I had seen my grandfather set
    food before the two skulls of the Big Birds’ ceremony.</p>

  <p>“No,” said my grandfather, “They eat the food’s spirit; for the food
    has a spirit as have all things. When the gods have eaten of its
    spirit, we often take back the food to eat ourselves.”</p>

  <p>“How do we know there are gods, grandfather?” I asked.</p>

  <p>“They appear to us in our dreams. That is why the medicine man fasts
    and cuts his flesh with knives. If he fasts long, he will fall in a
    vision. In this vision the gods will come and talk with him.”</p>

  <p>“What are the gods like?” I asked.</p>

  <p>“Like beings that live on this earth. Some are as men. Others are as
    birds, or beasts, or even plants and other things. Not all the gods are
    good. Some seek to harm us. The good gods send us buffaloes, and rain
    to make our corn grow.”</p>

  <p>“Do they send us thunder?” I asked. There had been a heavy storm the
    day before.</p>

  <p>“The thunder bird god sends us thunder,” said my grandfather. “He is
    like a great swallow, with wings that spread out like clouds. Lightning
    is the flash of his eyes. His scream makes the thunder.</p>

  <p>“Once in Five Villages,” my grandfather went on, “there lived a brave
    man who owned a gun. One day a storm blew up. As the man sat in his
    lodge, there came a clap of thunder and lightning struck his roof,
    tearing a great hole.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span></p>

  <p>“This did not frighten the man at all. Indeed, it angered him. He
    caught up his gun and fired it through the hole straight into the sky.
    ‘You thunder bird,’ he shouted, ‘stay away from my lodge. See this gun.
    If you come, I will shoot at you again!’”</p>

  <p>My grandfather paused to fill his pipe. “That was a brave man,” he said
    as he reached for a coal. “Perhaps the thunder bird loves brave men,
    and did not harm him. But it is not well to provoke the gods. My little
    granddaughter should never laugh at them nor speak of them lightly.”</p>

  <p>My grandfather spoke very solemnly.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak">KINSHIP, CLAN COUSINS</h2>
  </div>

  <p>We Hidatsas do not reckon our kin as white men do. If a white man
    marries, his wife is called by his name; and his children also, as
    Tom Smith, Mary Smith. We Indians had no family names. Every Hidatsa
    belonged to a clan; but a child, when he was born, became a member of
    his mother’s, not his father’s clan.</p>

  <p>An Indian calls all members of his clan his brothers and sisters. The
    men of his father’s clan he calls his clan fathers; and the women,
    his clan aunts. Thus I was born a member of the <i>Tsistska</i><a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>,
    or Prairie Chicken clan, because my mother was a <i>Tsistska</i>. My
    father was a member of the <i>Meedeepahdee</i>,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> or Rising Water
    clan. Members of the <i>Tsistska</i> clan are my brothers and sisters;
    but my father’s clan brothers, men of the <i>Meedeepahdee</i>, are my
    clan fathers, and his clan sisters are my clan aunts.</p>

  </div>

  <p>These relations meant much to us Indians. Members of a clan were
    bound to help one another in need, and thought the gods would punish
    them if they did not. Thus, if my mother was in need, members of the
    <i>Tsistska</i> clan helped her. If she was hungry, they gave her food.
    If her child was naughty, my mother called in a <i>Meedeepahdee</i> to
    punish him, a clan father, if the child was a boy; if a girl, a clan
    aunt; for parents did not punish their own children. Again, when my
    father died, his clan fathers and clan aunts it was, who bore him to
    the burial scaffold and prayed his ghost not to come back to trouble
    the villagers.</p>

  <p>Another clan relative is <i>makutsatee</i>,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> or clan cousin. I
    reckon as my clan cousins all members of my tribe whose fathers are my
    clan fathers. Thus, my mother, I have said, was a Prairie Chicken; my
    father, a member of the <i>Meedeepahdee</i>, or Rising Water, clan.
    Another woman, of what clan does not matter, is also married to a
    <i>Meedeepahdee</i>; her children will be my clan cousins, because
    their father, being a <i>Meedeepahdee</i>, is my clan father.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10">[10]</a> mä kṳt´ sä tēē
  </div>

  <p>Clan cousins had a custom that will seem strange to white people. We
    Indians are proud, and it makes our hearts sore if others make mock
    of us. In olden times if a man said to his friend, even in jest, “You
    are like a dog,” his friend would draw his knife to fight. I think we
    Indians are more careful of our words than white men are.</p>

  <div class="figleft illowp52">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_068.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>But it is never good for a man not to know his faults, and so we let
    one’s clan cousins tease him <span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>for any fault he had. Especially was
    this teasing common between young men and young women. Thus a young
    man might be unlucky in war. As he passed the fields where the village
    women hoed their corn, he would hear some mischievous girl, his clan
    cousin, singing a song taunting him for his ill success. Were any one
    else to do this, the young man would be ready to fight; but, seeing
    that the singer was his clan cousin, he would laugh and call out, “Sing
    louder cousin, sing louder, that I may hear you.”</p>

  <p>I can best explain this custom by telling you a story:</p>

  <h3><b>Story of Snake Head-Ornament</b></h3>

  <p>A long time ago, in one of our villages at Knife river, lived a man
    named <i>Mapuksaokihe</i>,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> or Snake Head-Ornament. He was a great
    medicine man. In a hole in the floor of his earth lodge, there lived a
    bull snake. Snake Head-Ornament called the bull snake “father.”</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11">[11]</a> Mä pṳk´ sä ō kēē hĕ
  </div>

  <p>When Snake Head-Ornament was invited to a feast, he would paint his
    face, wrap himself in his best robe and say, “Come, father; let us go
    and get something to eat.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>

  <p>The bull snake would creep from his hole, crawl up the man’s body and
    coil about his neck, thrusting his head over the man’s forehead; or he
    would coil about the man’s head like the headcloth of a hunter, with
    his head thrust forward, as I have said.</p>

  <p>Bearing the snake thus on his head, Snake Head-Ornament would enter the
    lodge where the feast was held and sit down to eat. The snake, however,
    did not eat of the food that Snake Head-Ornament ate. The snake’s food
    was scrapings of buffalo hides that the women of the lodge fed him.</p>

  <p>When Snake Head-Ornament came home, he would say to the bull snake,
    “Father, get off.” And the snake would crawl down the man’s body and
    into his den again.</p>

  <p>Snake Head-Ornament fasted and had a vision. In the vision his gods, he
    thought, bade him go to war. He made up a war party and led it against
    enemies on the Yellowstone river. The party not only killed no enemies,
    but lost three of their own men; and they thought Snake Head-Ornament
    was to blame for it. “You said your prayers were strong,” they said;
    “and we have lost three men! Your gods have not helped us.”</p>

  <div class="figleft illowp38">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_070.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>Snake Head-Ornament thought his gods were angry with him; and when he
    came home he went about crying and mourning and calling upon his gods
    to give him another vision. “Pity me, gods,” he cried, “make me strong
    that I may bring home scalps and horses.” He was a brave man, and his
    bad fortune made his heart sore.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

  <p>In those days, when a man mourned he cut off his hair, painted his body
    with white clay, and threw away his moccasins. He also cut his flesh
    with a knife or some sharp weapon. Now when a man sought a vision from
    the gods, he wept and mourned, that the gods might have pity on him;
    and for this he went away from the village, alone, into the hills. So
    it happened, that Snake Head-Ornament, on his way to the hills, went
    mourning and crying past a field where sat a woman, his clan cousin, on
    her watch-stage. Seeing him, she began a song to tease him:</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">He said, “I am a young bird!”</div>
        <div class="i0">If a young bird, he should be in his nest;</div>
        <div class="i0">But he comes here looking gray,</div>
        <div class="i0">And wanders about outside the village!</div>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">He said, “I am a young snake!”</div>
        <div class="i0">If a young snake, he should be in the hills among the red buttes;</div>
        <div class="i0">But he comes here looking gray and crying,</div>
        <div class="i0">And wanders aimlessly about!</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>When the woman sang, “He comes here looking gray,” she meant that the
    man was gray from the white-clay paint on his body.</p>

  <p>Snake Head-Ornament heard her song; but, knowing she was his clan
    sister, he cried out to her: “Sing louder, cousin! You are right; let
    my ‘fathers’ hear what you say. I do not know if they will feel shame
    or not, but the bull snake and the bald eagle both called me ‘son’!”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span></p>

  <p>What he meant was that the bull snake and the bald eagle were his dream
    gods. That is, they had appeared to him in a dream, and promised to
    help him as they would a son, when he went to war. In her song, the
    woman taunted him with this. If she had not been his clan cousin, he
    would have been beside himself with anger. As it was, he but laughed
    and did not hurt her.</p>

  <p>But the woman had cause for singing her song. Years before, when Snake
    Head-Ornament was a very young man, he went out with a war party and
    killed a Sioux woman. When he came home the people called him brave,
    and made much of him; and he grew quite puffed up now that all looked
    up to him.</p>

  <p>Not long after, he was made a member of the Black Mouth society.
    It happened one day, that the women were building a fence of logs,
    set upright around the village, to defend it from enemies. Snake
    Head-Ornament, as a member of the Black Mouths, was one of the men
    overseeing the work. This woman, his clan cousin, was slow at her task;
    and, to make her move more briskly, Snake Head-Ornament came close to
    her and fired off his gun just past her knees. She screamed, but seeing
    it was Snake Head-Ornament who had shot, and knowing he was her clan
    cousin, she did not get angry. Nevertheless, she did not forget! And,
    years after, she had revenge in her taunting song.</p>

  <hr class="tb" />

  <p>Young men going out with a war party had to take much chaffing from
    older warriors who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span> were clan cousins. My brother was once out with a
    party of fifty, many of them young men. They were fleeing from a big
    camp of Sioux and had ridden for two days. The second night one of the
    younger men, a mere lad, fell asleep as he rode his pony. An older
    warrior, his clan cousin, fired a gun past the lad’s ear. “Young man,”
    he cried, “you sleep so soundly that only thunder can waken you!” The
    rest of the party thought the warrior’s words a huge joke.</p>

    <div class="large mt2">EIGHTH CHAPTER</div>
    <h2 class="nobreak">INDIAN DOGS</h2>
  </div>

  <p>In old times we Indian people had no horses, and not many families of
    my tribe owned them when I was a little girl. But I do not think there
    ever was a time when we Hidatsas did not own dogs. We trained them to
    draw our tent poles and our loaded travois. We never used dogs to chase
    deer, as white men do.</p>

  <p>Our Hidatsa dogs—the breed we owned when I was a little girl—had broad
    faces, with gentle, knowing eyes; erect, pointed ears; and tails
    curling, never trailing like a wolf’s tail. They had soft silky hair,
    gray, black, or spotted red or white. All had stout, heavy legs. I
    think this sturdiness was because we saved only dogs of stout build to
    drag our travois.</p>

  <p>The Teton Sioux, who lived south of us, owned dogs like ours, but of
    slenderer build and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span> legs. They liked these dogs, I think, because they
    were speedier; for the Sioux were hunters, always moving from place to
    place.</p>

  <p>Almost every family in Like-a-Fishhook village owned two or more dogs;
    and, as there were about seventy lodges in the village, our dogs made
    a large pack. The dogs knew every man and child in the village, and
    being, besides, well trained, seldom bit anyone. But they were quick to
    wind a stranger. A visitor from another tribe was sure to be beset by a
    troop of dogs, growling and barking at his heels.</p>

  <p>The dogs had one habit I liked. Every evening about bedtime—and bedtime
    for a little Indian girl was early—some dog was sure to start up,
    <i>wu-wu-wu!</i> And all the others would join in, even the little
    puppies. I used to lie in my bed and listen to them.</p>

  <div class="figleft illowp64">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_074.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>About midnight, the barking would start up again, especially if there
    was a moon, and again a little before daylight; but I was usually
    asleep at these hours.</p>

  <p>In daytime lookouts were always on the roofs of some of the lodges
    watching if enemies or buffaloes were about. If they saw our hunters,
    with meat, coming home over the prairie, these lookouts would cry out,
    “<i>Hey-da-ey!</i>”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> And the dogs, knowing what the cry meant, would
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>join in with “<i>wu-u-u-u</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> They liked fresh buffalo meat no
    less than the Indians.</p>

  </div>

  <p>But the greatest excitement was when enemies were seen. The lookouts
    then cried, “<i>Ahahuts<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>—they come against us!</i>” Warriors, on
    hearing the cry, seized weapons and ran out of their lodges, yelling
    shrilly. The chiefs sprang for their ponies, twisting lariats into the
    ponies’ mouths for bridles. Medicine men chanted holy songs, and women
    ran about calling to their children. But above all rose the barking of
    the dogs, every beast joining in the hubbub.</p>

  <p>One day, after the midday meal—I think I was then eight years old—old
    Turtle went down to the river and fetched an armful of dry willows.
    They were about four feet long and as thick as a child’s wrist; some
    were forked at the top. She set them in a circle, with tops together
    like a tepee, at one side of the lodge entrance near the place where
    the dogs slept.</p>

  <p>“What are you doing, grandmother?” I asked.</p>

  <p>Turtle did not answer my question. “I want to get some dry grass,” she
    said. “Come and help me.”</p>

  <p>We went out to a place in the hills where was some long, dead grass.
    Turtle pulled a big armful, piling it on her robe which she spread on
    the ground. She drew the corners of the robe together, slung the bundle
    over her shoulder and we came back to the village.</p>

  <p>She laid the grass thickly over the sides of the little tepee, leaning
    chunks of wood against it to keep the grass in place. She left a door,
    or <span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>opening, in front; and she even bound a stick over the door, like
    the pole over the door of a hunting lodge. Last, she put grass inside,
    as if for a bed.</p>

  <div class="figleft illowp55">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_076.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>“Grandmother, what <i>are</i> you doing?” I begged; but she led me into
    the lodge, telling me nothing.</p>

  <p>I was awakened early the next morning by dogs barking on the roof. As I
    lay listening, I thought I heard a faint whining outside. It seemed to
    come from the place where the little grass tepee stood.</p>

  <p>I fell asleep, and awoke a second time to see Red Blossom fanning the
    fire with a goose wing. Breakfast was soon ready, of fresh boiled
    buffalo meat. The hunters had come in only the night before, and they
    had brought a fresh side-and-ribs for a present to my father.</p>

  <p>After the meal I saw Turtle gather up the scraps of meat into a wooden
    bowl. “Come,” she said, leading me out of the lodge.</p>

  <p>She stopped before the tepee, and thrust the bowl of scraps within.
    Again I heard the faint whining. I dropped to my knees and looked in.
    There I saw our best dog, the pet of us all; and beside her lay four
    little puppies.</p>

  <p>“<i>Eh, sukkeets!</i>”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> I cried, “Oh, good!” And I drew the puppies
    out one by one, to cuddle them. The mother dog whined, and raised
    her eyes to me. She was a gentle dog and did not snap at my hand.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>

  <div class="footnote">

  <div class="figright illowp42">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_077.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>I do not know whether I or the puppies’ mother cuddled them more, the
    next few days. One puppy I came to love dearly. He was a wriggling
    little thing, with a bob tail for all the world like a rabbit’s,
    except that it hung down. There were ten or more bobtailed dogs in
    the village all of them born so. My puppy was black, so I named him
    <i>Sheepeesha</i>,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> or Blackie.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16">[16]</a> Shēē´ pēē shä
  </div>

  <p>It must have been a funny sight to see me take my puppy out for a walk.
    Stooping, I would lay the puppy between my shoulders and draw my tiny
    robe up over his back; and I would walk off proud as any Indian mother
    of her new babe. The old mother dog would creep half out of her kennel,
    following me with her gentle eyes. I was careful not to go out of her
    sight.</p>

  <p>When the puppies were ten days old my grandmother brought in some fresh
    sage, the kind we Indians use in a sweat lodge. She laid the sage by
    the fireplace and fetched in the puppies, barring the door so that
    the mother dog could not come in. I could hear the poor dog whining
    pitifully.</p>

  <p>“What are you going to do, grandmother?” I asked.</p>

  <p>“I am going to smoke the puppies.”</p>

  <p>“Why, grandmother?” I cried.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>

  <p>“Because the puppies are old enough to eat cooked meat, for their
    teeth have come through. The sage is a sacred plant. Its smoke will
    make the puppies hungry, so that they will eat.”</p>

  <p>While she was speaking, she opened my little pet’s jaws. Sure enough,
    four white teeth were coming through the gums.</p>

  <p>Turtle raked some coals from the ashes, and laid on them a handful of
    the sage. A column of thick white smoke arose upward to the smoke hole.</p>

  <p>My grandmother took my puppy in her hands and held his head in the
    smoke. The poor puppy struggled and choked. Thick spittle, like suds,
    came out of his mouth. I was frightened, and thought he was going to
    die.</p>

  <p>“The smoke will make the puppy healthy,” said Turtle. “Now let us see
    if he will grow up strong, to carry my little granddaughter’s tent.”</p>

  <p>She lifted the puppy, still choking, from the floor, and let him fall
    so that he landed on his feet. The puppy was still young and weak, and
    he was strangling; but his little legs stiffened, and he stood without
    falling.</p>

  <p>“Hey, hey,” laughed my grandmother. “This is a strong dog! He will grow
    up to carry your tent.” For in old times, when traveling, we Hidatsas
    made our dogs drag our tents on poles, like travois.</p>

  <p>Turtle tried the other three puppies. One, not as strong as the
    rest, fell on his side. “This dog will not grow up strong,” said my
    grandmother. “I will give him to my neighbor, who asks for one.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span></p>

  <p>She now lifted a clay pot out of the ashes, and from it poured
    something into a flat bowl; corn mush, I think it was, boiled with
    buffalo fats. She set the bowl before the puppies. They quickly lapped
    up the mush, with funny red tongues. My little black puppy even gulped
    down a lump of fat.</p>

  <div class="figright illowp48">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_079.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>Turtle laughed. “I told you your puppy is strong,” she cried. “He will
    soon grow up to carry your tent. But to grow, our puppies must be fed.
    It will be your work to feed them. See they do not starve.”</p>

  <p>But, if I had to feed the puppies, my grandmother also helped. Indeed,
    the whole family watched to see that they had enough. If fresh meat
    was brought in, we always boiled some and gave to the puppies. We did
    not give them raw meat. “It is not good for puppies. It will make them
    sick,” said Turtle.</p>

  <p>But, as the puppies grew up, we began to feed them raw meat. My
    grandmother sometimes boiled corn for them, into a coarse mush. They
    were fond of this. As they grew older, any food that turned sour or was
    unfit for the family to eat was given me for my doggies. They ate it
    greedily. It did not seem to harm them.</p>

  <p>Sometimes a deer or elk was killed, that was poor in flesh. Such a
    carcass was cut up and given to the dogs of the village, and of course
    mine got their share.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span></p>

  <p>When several buffaloes were killed, the hunters often could not carry
    all the meat home, and took only the best cuts. The next day any one
    who wanted, could go out and take the cast-away pieces for her dogs.
    Then, there were parts that we always threw away or gave to the dogs.
    The tough, outside meat of a buffalo’s hams we cut off and saved for
    the dogs. The inside meat, next the bone, we thought our very best.
    Hunters were fond of roasting it before the fire, on two stones.</p>

  <p>Even in famine times we did not forget our dogs; but we sometimes had
    only soft bones to give them that had been broken for boiling. The dogs
    gnawed these, and so got a little food.</p>

  <p>We Hidatsas loved our good dogs, and were kind to them.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak">TRAINING A DOG</h2>
  </div>

  <p>Autumn twice came around, and my puppy had grown into a romping dog.
    In the moon of Yellow Leaves, my tribe went again into winter camp. We
    returned to Like-a-Fishhook village rather early in the spring. Patches
    of snow lay on the ground, and the ice was still firm on the Missouri
    when we crossed. We reached the village in midafternoon.</p>

  <p>My father had two pack horses loaded with our stuff and our dogs
    dragged well-laden travois. While my mothers were unpacking, my father
    made a fire. He drew his flint and steel, and with a bit of soft,
    rotten wood for tinder struck a spark. In olden times the Hidatsas made
    fire with two sticks. “I saw very old men make fire thus, when I was a
    lad,” my grandfather once told me. I never saw it done myself.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p>

  <p>Small Ankle wrapped the spark, caught in the tinder, in a little bunch
    of dry grass, and waved it in the air until the grass was ablaze. He
    had raked together some bits of charcoal in the fireplace and on them
    laid a few dry-wood splinters. To these he held the burning grass and
    soon had a fire.</p>

  <p>There was a little firewood in the lodge, left from the previous
    autumn, but not enough to keep the fire going long. As my mothers were
    still unpacking, my father offered to go out and get wood for the
    night. Getting wood, we thought, was woman’s work; but my father was a
    kind man, willing to help his wives.</p>

  <p>From the saddle of one of his horses Small Ankle took a rawhide lariat,
    and to one end fastened a short stick. There were some cottonwoods
    under the river bank, not far from the village. Into one of the largest
    trees Small Ankle threw his lariat until the stick caught in some dead
    branches overhead. A sharp pull broke off the branches. My father
    gathered them up and bore them to the lodge.</p>

  <p>There were logs and dead wood lying along the river, but they were wet
    with the snows. My father knew the dead branches in the trees would be
    dried by the winds. He wanted dry wood to kindle a quick fire.</p>

  <p>The next morning after we had eaten, Red Blossom took her ax, and,
    dragging a travois from its place against the fire screen, led the way
    out of the lodge. Strikes-Many Woman followed her. Our biggest dog,
    lying outside,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span> saw them coming. He got up, shaking himself, wagging
    his tail, and barking <i>wu-wu-wu!</i> Our dogs were always ready to
    be harnessed. They liked to go to the woods, knowing they would be fed
    well afterwards.</p>

  <p>This, our best dog, was named <i>Akeekahee</i>,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> or Took-from-Him.
    He belonged to Red Blossom. A woman owning a dog would ask some brave
    man of her family to name him for her; and Red Blossom had asked my
    grandfather, Big Cloud, to name her dog. Once an enemy had stolen his
    horse, but Big Cloud gave chase and retook his horse from that bad
    enemy. For this, he named the dog Took-from-Him.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17">[17]</a> Ȧ kēē´ kä hēē
  </div>

  <div class="figcenter illowp100">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_083.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>My mothers harnessed their dogs, four in number and started off. They
    returned a little after midday; first, Red Blossom, with a great pack
    of wood on her back; after her, Strikes-Many Woman; then the four dogs,
    marching one behind the other, Took-from-Him in the lead. Each dog
    dragged a travois loaded with wood.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>

  <p>My mothers dropped their loads before the lodge entrance. The dogs
    were unhitched; and, while old Turtle fed them, Strikes-Many Woman
    carried the wood into the lodge and piled it by the corral, where it
    was handy to the fire.</p>

  <p>I was eager to have my dog broken to harness and begged my grandmother
    to make a travois for him. “I will,” she said, “but wait another moon.
    Your dog will then be fed fat, after the long winter. A dog should be
    two years old, and strong, when he is broken. To work a dog too young
    or when he is weak will hurt his back.”</p>

  <p>A month after this, my mothers came home one afternoon from
    woodgathering, dragging each a cottonwood pole about eight feet long.
    They peeled these poles bare of bark, and laid them up on the corn
    stage to dry.</p>

  <p>“What are the poles for?” I asked.</p>

  <p>“They are for your travois,” said my grandmother. “Your dog
    <i>Sheepeesha</i> is now old enough to work; and my little
    granddaughter, too, must learn to be useful.”
  </p>

  <p>I was ready to cry out and dance, when I heard these words of my
    grandmother; and I thought I could never, never wait until those poles
    dried. The heavy ladder we used for mounting the stage lay on the
    ground when not in use. I was too little to lift it, to climb up to the
    poles; but I went every day to stand below and gaze at them longingly.</p>

  <p>One afternoon my grandmother fetched the poles into the lodge. “They
    are dry now,” she said. “I will make the travois frame.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span></p>

  <p>With her big knife she hacked the greater ends of the poles flat, so
    that they would run smooth on the ground. The small ends she crossed
    for the joint, cutting a notch in each to make them fit. She bound the
    joint with strips of the big tendon in a buffalo’s neck that we Indians
    call the <i>eetsuta</i><a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>. These strips drew taut as they dried,
    making the joint firm.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18">[18]</a> ēēt sṳ´ tä
  </div>

  <p>Turtle now drew a saddle, or cushion, over the poles just under the
    joint, sewing it down with buckskin thongs. This saddle was to keep the
    dog from fretting his shoulders against the poles.</p>

  <p>The hoop for the basket was of ash. My father webbed it. He cut a
    long, thin thong from the edges of a hide, and soaked it to make it
    soft. Taking some wet paint in his palm, he drew the thong through it,
    thus painting it a bright red. He laced the thong over the hoop and my
    grandmother bound the basket in place.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illowp100">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_085.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>The harness was of two pieces: a collar, to go around the dog’s
    neck; and a breast thong, that was drawn across his chest and through a
    loop in the saddle, was lapped once or twice around one of the travois
    poles, and was finally carried under the dog’s body to the other pole,
    where it was made fast.</p>

  <p>I could hardly wait to eat my breakfast the next morning, for my
    mothers had promised to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>take me with them to gather wood. “And we are
    going to begin training your dog to-day,” they told me.</p>

  <p>I knew a dog should be fed before he was harnessed, and I saved half my
    breakfast meat to give to mine. Owning a dog, and invited to go with
    my mothers to get wood, I felt that in spite of my girlish years I was
    almost a woman now.</p>

  <p>Breakfast ended, Red Blossom fetched the new travois and laid it on
    my dog’s back. He looked up, puzzled, then sank to the ground and lay
    wagging his tail from side to side, sweeping a clean place in the dust.
    Red Blossom bound the collar about his neck, and drew and fastened the
    breast thong. While she was doing this I gently patted my dog’s head.</p>

  <p>“<i>Nah!</i>” said Red Blossom, “Come!” But my doggie was a bit
    frightened. He twisted about, trying to rid himself of the travois, but
    only hurt himself. He looked up at me and whined. Red Blossom tied a
    thong to his collar and put the end in my hand. “Lead him,” she said.
    “He will follow the other dogs.” She led off, Strikes-Many Woman behind
    her, and the dogs followed after, in a line.</p>

  <p>I tugged at my dog’s thong, pursing my lips and making a whistling
    sound, as Indians do. My doggie understood. He rose to his feet, and,
    seeing the other dogs moving off, followed after the last one.</p>

  <p>We thus came to the woods, about a mile and a half from the village.
    The dogs sank in their tracks, to rest. My mothers searched about for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
    dead-and-dry wood, which they cut into lengths of two feet or more, and
    piled them in the path near the dogs.</p>

  <p>When they had enough wood cut, my mothers lifted each travois by its
    basket, and turned it so that the dog’s nose was pointed toward the
    village; and they loaded each travois with a double armful of wood,
    bound to the basket with two thongs. My two mothers then lifted each a
    load to her own back, and started to the village.</p>

  <p>I did not carry any load myself, as my shoulders were not strong enough
    for such heavy work; but I led my dog. Not a very big load was put on
    him, as it was his first. I called to him, tugging gently at the thong.
    Seeing the other dogs ahead, he followed willingly.</p>

  <p>Old Turtle awaited us at the door. “Grandmother,” I cried joyfully,
    “my dog has brought home a load of wood. He did not try to run away.”
    Turtle laughed, and helped me unload.</p>

  <p>That evening I was sitting by the fire with my good dog, for Red
    Blossom had let me bring him into the lodge. Now and then I slipped him
    a bit of meat I had saved from my supper. My father had laid some dry
    sticks on the fire, and the blaze flickered and rose, flickered and
    rose, making post and rafter yellow with its light. Small Ankle sat on
    his couch smoking his pipe. Suddenly I heard the clitter of the hollow
    hoofs as the lodge door was raised and let fall again. I looked up.
    Coyote Eyes, a Ree Indian, was coming around the screen.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span></p>

  <p>“<i>Hau!</i>”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> cried my father, making a place for him on the couch.
    Small Ankle was a polite man. He handed his pipe to the Ree, who took
    big pulls, blowing the smoke through his nostrils.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19">[19]</a> Hau (How)
  </div>

  <p>Coyote Eyes gave the pipe back to my father. “That is a fine dog you
    have,” he said to me. “I know a story of my tribe about two dogs.”</p>

  <p>Being but a little girl, I did not think it proper for me to talk to a
    stranger, but my father answered for me, “What is the story?”</p>

  <p>“In the beginning, my tribe came out of a cave in the earth,” said
    Coyote Eyes. “They journeyed until they came to the Missouri river.
    ‘Let us go up this river,’ they said, ‘and find a place to build our
    villages.’ They were weary of journeying.</p>

  <div class="figleft illowp60">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_088.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>“They had two dogs in the camp. One was black; his name was Death. The
    other was white, and her name was Sickness. These dogs were asleep when
    the tribe broke camp the next morning. The people were in such haste to
    be off that they forgot to waken the dogs.</p>

  <p>“The third day after, they saw two great fires sweeping toward them
    over the prairie. The women cried out with fear. All thought that they
    should die.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span></p>

  <p>“When the fires came near, the people saw that they were the two dogs,
    Death and Sickness.</p>

  <p>“‘Do not fear,’ said the dogs. ‘Our hearts are not all evil. True, we
    will bite you, because you forgot us; but we will also live with you
    and be your friends. We will carry your burdens; and when we die, you
    shall eat us.’</p>

  <p>“The dogs grew old. The white one died, and her skin became the squash.
    Now our squashes are of different colors, white, gray, yellow, spotted,
    just as are dogs. These squashes we eat. Also we Rees eat dog meat;
    for, before he died, the black dog said, ‘You shall eat my flesh.’</p>

  <p>“And to this day, when our Ree people sicken and die, they say, ‘We are
    bitten by Sickness and Death.’”</p>

  <p>My father smiled. “We Hidatsas do not eat dogs,” he said; and then to
    me, “Little daughter, it is bedtime.”</p>

  <p>I did not always obey my mothers; for, like all little girls, I was
    naughty sometimes, but I dared not disobey my father.</p>

  <p>I put my dog out of the lodge, and went to bed.</p>

    <div class="large mt2">TENTH CHAPTER</div>
    <h2 class="nobreak">LEARNING TO WORK</h2>
  </div>

  <p>My mothers began to teach me household tasks when I was about twelve
    years old. “You are getting to be a big girl,” they said. “Soon you
    will be a woman, and marry. Unless you learn to work, how will you feed
    your family?”</p>

  <p>One of the things given me to do was fetching water from the river. No
    spring was near our village; and, anyhow, our prairie springs are often
    bitter with alkali. But the Missouri river, fed by melting snows of
    the Montana mountains, gave us plenty of fresh water. Missouri river
    water is muddy; but it soon settles, and is cool and sweet to drink. We
    Indians love our big river, and we are glad to drink of its waters, as
    drank our fathers.</p>

  <p>A steep path led down the bank to the watering place. Down this path,
    the village girls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span> made their way every morning to get water for
    drinking and cooking. They went in little groups or in pairs. Two
    girls, cousins or chums, sometimes swung a freshly filled pail from a
    pole on their shoulders.</p>

  <div class="figright illowp38">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_091.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>But there were few pails of metal in my tribe, when I was a
    little girl. I used to fetch water in a clay pot, sometimes in a
    buffalo-paunch lining skewered on a stick; but my commonest bucket was
    of a buffalo heart skin. When my father killed a buffalo, he took out
    the heart skin, and filled it with grass until it dried. This he gave
    to Red Blossom, who sewed a little stick on each side of the mouth; and
    bound a short stick and sinews between them for handle. Such a bucket
    held about three pints. It was a frail looking vessel, but lasted a
    long time.</p>

  <p>We girls liked to go to the watering place; for, while we were filling
    our buckets, we could gossip with our friends. For older girls and
    young men it was a place for courtship. A youth, with painted face and
    trailing hair switch, would loiter near the path, and smile slyly at
    his sweetheart as she passed. She did not always smile back. Sometimes
    for long weeks, she held her eyes away, not even glancing at his
    moccasins. It was a shy smile that she gave him, at last. Nor did she
    talk with her love-boy—as we called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span> him—when others were about. We
    should have thought that silly. But he might wait for her at sunset, by
    her father’s lodge, and talk with her in the twilight.</p>

  <p>But I had other tasks besides fetching water. I learned to cook,
    sweep, and sew with awl and sinew. Red Blossom taught me to embroider
    with quills of gull and porcupine, dyed in colors. Sometimes I helped
    at harder work; gathered drift wood at the river, dressed or scraped
    hides, and even helped in our cornfield.</p>

  <p>I liked to go with my mothers to the cornfields in planting time, when
    the spring sun was shining and the birds singing in the tree tops. How
    good it seemed to be out under the open sky, after the long months in
    our winter camp! A cottonwood tree stood at a turn of the road to our
    field. Every season a pair of magpies built their nest in it. They were
    saucy birds and scolded us roundly when we passed. How I used to laugh
    at their wicked scoldings!</p>

  <p>I am afraid I did not help my mothers much. Like any young girl, I
    liked better to watch the birds than to work. Sometimes I chased away
    the crows. Our corn indeed had many enemies, and we had to watch that
    they did not get our crop. Magpies and crows destroyed much of the
    young corn. Crows were fond of pulling up the plants when they were
    a half inch or an inch high. Spotted gophers dug up the roots of the
    young corn, to nibble the soft seed.</p>

  <p>When our field was all planted, Red Blossom used to go back and replant
    any hills that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span> birds had destroyed. Where she found a plant
    missing, she dug a little hole with her hand and dropped in a seed, or
    I dropped it in for her.</p>

  <p>It was hard work, stooping to plant in the hot sun, and Red Blossom
    never liked having to go over the field a second time. “Those bad
    crows,” she would groan, “they make us much trouble.”</p>

  <div class="figright illowp44">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_093.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>My grandmother Turtle made scarecrows to frighten away the birds. In
    the middle of the field she drove two sticks for legs, and bound two
    other sticks to them for arms; on the top, she fastened a ball of
    cast-away skins for a head. She belted an old robe about the figure to
    make it look like a man. Such a scarecrow looked wicked! Indeed I was
    almost afraid of it myself. But the bad crows, seeing the scarecrow
    never moved from its place, soon lost their fear, and came back.</p>

  <p>In the months of midsummer, the crows did not give us much trouble;
    but, as the moon of Cherries drew near, they became worse than ever.
    The corn had now begun to ear, and crows and blackbirds came in flocks
    to peck open the green ears for the soft kernels. Many families now
    built stages in their fields, where the girls and young women of the
    household came to sit and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span> sing as they watched that crows and other
    thieves did not steal the ripening grain.</p>

  <p>We cared for our corn in those days, as we would care for a child; for
    we Indian people loved our fields as mothers love their children. We
    thought that the corn plants had souls, as children have souls, and
    that the growing corn liked to hear us sing, as children like to hear
    their mothers sing to them. Nor did we want the birds to come and steal
    our corn, after the hard work of planting and hoeing. Horses, too,
    might break into the field, or boys might steal the green ears and go
    off and roast them.</p>

  <p>A watchers’ stage was not hard to build. Four posts, forked at the
    tops, upheld beams, on which was laid a floor of puncheons, or split
    small logs, at the height of the full grown corn. The floor was about
    four feet long by three wide, roomy enough for two girls to sit
    together comfortably. Often a soft robe was spread on the floor. A
    ladder made of the trunk of a tree rested against the stage. The ladder
    had three steps.</p>

  <p>A tree was often left standing in the field, to shade the watchers’
    stage. If the tree was small and more shade was wanted, a robe was
    stretched over three poles leaned against the stage. These poles could
    be shifted with the sun.</p>

  <p>Girls began to go on the watchers’ stage when about ten or twelve
    years of age, and many kept up the custom after they were grown up and
    married. Older women, working in the field and stopping to rest, often
    went on the stage and sang.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span></p>

  <div class="figright illowp57">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_095.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>There was a watchers’ stage in my mothers’ field, where my sister, Cold
    Medicine, and I sat and sang; and in the two weeks of the ripening
    season we were singing most of the time. We looked upon watching our
    field as a kind of lark. We liked to sing, and now and then between
    songs we stood up to see if horses had broken into the field or if
    any boys were about. Boys of nine or ten years of age were quite
    troublesome. They liked to steal the green ears to roast by a fire in
    the woods.</p>

  <p>I think Cold Medicine and I were rather glad to catch a boy stealing
    our corn, especially if he was a clan cousin, for then we could call
    him all the bad names we wished. “You bad, bad boy,” we would cry. “You
    thief,—stealing from your own relatives! <i>Nah, nah</i>,—go away.”
    This was enough; no boy stayed after such a scolding.</p>

  <p>Most of the songs we sang were love-boy songs, as we called them; but
    not all were. One that we younger girls were fond of singing—girls,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
    that is, of about twelve years of age—was like this:</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">You bad boys, you are all alike!</div>
        <div class="i0">Your bow is like a bent basket hoop;</div>
        <div class="i0">Your arrows are fit only to shoot into the air;</div>
        <div class="i0">You poor boys, you must run on the prairie barefoot, because you have no moccasins!</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This song we sang to tease the boys who came to hunt birds in the
    near-by woods. Small boys went bird hunting nearly every day. The birds
    that a boy snared or shot he gave to his grandparents to roast in the
    lodge fire; for, with their well-worn teeth, old people could no longer
    chew our hard, dried buffalo meat.</p>

  <p>Here is another song; but, that you may understand it, I will explain
    to you what <i>eekupa</i><a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> means. A girl loved by another girl as
    her own sister was called her <i>eekupa</i>. I think your word “chum,”
    as you explain it, has nearly the same meaning. This is the song:</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“My <i>eekupa</i>, what do you wish to see?” you said to me.</div>
        <div class="i0">What I wish to see is the corn silk peeping out of the growing ear;</div>
        <div class="i0">But what <i>you</i> wish to see is that naughty young man coming!</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20">[20]</a> ēē´ kṳ pä
  </div>

  <p>Here is a song that older girls sang to tease young men of the Dog
    Society who happened to be going by:</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">You young man of the Dog Society, you said to me,</div>
        <div class="i0">“When I go east with a war party, you will hear news of me how brave I am!”</div>
        <div class="i0">I have heard news of you;</div>
        <div class="i0">When the fight was on, you ran and hid;</div>
        <div class="i0">And you still think you are a brave young man!</div>
        <div class="i0">Behold, you have joined the Dog Society;</div>
        <div class="i0">But I call you just plain <i>dog</i>!</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Songs that we sang on the watchers’ stage we called
    <i>meedaheeka</i>,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> or gardeners’ songs. I have said that many of
    them were love-boy <span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>songs, and were intended to tease. We called a
    girl’s sweetheart her love-boy. All girls, we know, like to tease their
    sweethearts.</p>

  <p>At one side of our field Turtle had made a booth, diamond willows
    thrust in the ground in a circle, with leafy tops bent over and tied
    together. In this booth, my sister and I, with our mothers and old
    Turtle, cooked our meals. We started a fire in the booth as soon as we
    got to the field, and ate our breakfast often at sunrise. Our food we
    had brought with us, usually buffalo meat, fresh or dried. Fresh meat
    we laid on the coals to broil. Dried meat we thrust on a stick and held
    over the fire to toast.</p>

  <p>Sometimes we brought a clay cooking pot, and boiled squashes. We were
    fond of squashes and ate many of them. We sometimes boiled green corn
    and beans. My sister and I shelled the corn from the cob. We shelled
    the beans or boiled them in the pod. My grandmother poured the mess in
    a wooden bowl, and we ate with spoons which she made from squash stems.
    She would split a stem with her knife and put in a little stick to hold
    the split open.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>

  <p>I do not think anything can taste sweeter than a mess of fresh corn and
    beans, in the cool morning air, when the birds are twittering and the
    sun is just peeping over the tree tops.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak">PICKING JUNE BERRIES</h2>
  </div>

  <p>June berry time had come. I was now fourteen years, old and had begun
    to think myself almost a young woman. Some of the young men even smiled
    at me as I came up from the watering place. I never smiled back, for
    I thought: “My father is a chief, and I belong to one of the best
    families in my tribe. I will be careful whom I choose to be my friends.”</p>

  <p>A little north of my father’s, stood the earth lodge of Bear Man’s
    family. Bear Man was an eagle hunter. He had magic snares of sacred
    hemp plant which he tossed into the air as he prayed to the eagle
    spirits. After doing so he was sure to catch many young golden eagles
    at his eagle pit. We thought him a great medicine man.</p>

  <p>Bear Man had a son named Sacred-Red-Eagle-Wing, a straight-limbed,
    rather good-looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span> lad, a year older than myself. Bear Man’s
    father died, and Bear Man cut off his long hair in mourning.
    Sacred-Red-Eagle-Wing made a switch of his father’s hair, tastefully
    spotting it with little lumps of spruce gum mixed with red ochre. He
    looked quite manly, I thought, wearing this switch, in spite of his
    fifteen years.</p>

  <div class="figleft illowp54">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_100.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>My father’s earth lodge and Bear Man’s both faced eastward, with the
    lodge of Blue Paint’s family standing between; but, as I stood at my
    father’s lodge entrance, I could see the flat top of Bear Man’s lodge
    over Blue Paint’s roof. Sacred-Red-Eagle-Wing had joined the Stone
    Hammer Society a short while before, and had begun to paint his face
    like a young man. He would get up on his father’s roof, painted, and
    decked out in hair switch, best leggings, and moccasins, and sing his
    society’s songs. He had a fine voice, I thought; and when I went out
    with my buck-brush broom to sweep the ground about our lodge entrance,
    Sacred-Red-Eagle-Wing would sing harder than ever. I thought perhaps he
    did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span> this so that I would hear him. I was too well-bred to look up at
    him, but I did not always hurry to finish my sweeping.</p>

  <p>There had been plenty of rain, and the June berry trees were now loaded
    with ripe fruit. We Indians set great store by these berries, and
    almost every family dried one or more sackfuls for winter. June berries
    are sweet, and, as we had no sugar, we were fond of them.</p>

  <p>We were sitting one evening at our supper. Red Blossom had gone into
    the woods earlier in the day and fetched home some ripe June berries
    which we were eating. Perhaps that is why we ended our meal with
    our kettle half-full of boiled meat. “We will save this meat until
    morning,” Red Blossom said. “We must breakfast early, for Strikes-Many
    Woman and I are going with a party to pick June berries. Our daughter
    may go with us, if she will.”</p>

  <p>I was quite happy when I heard this. I had seen my two mothers getting
    ready their berry sacks; and, looking over to the bench where they lay,
    I now saw that a small sack had been laid out for me.</p>

  <p>Red Blossom dipped her fingers into the kettle for a lump of fat and
    continued: “The mother of that young man, Sacred-Red-Eagle-Wing, said
    to me to-day, ‘If your daughter goes berrying to-morrow, my son wishes
    to go with her. He will take his bow and keep off enemies.”</p>

  <p>I did not blush, for we Indian girls had dark skins and painted our
    cheeks; but I felt my heart jump. I looked down at the floor, then got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
    up and went about my work, humming a song as I did so; for I thought,
    “I am going berrying in the morning.” I felt quite grown-up to know
    that a young man wanted to go berrying with me.</p>

  <div class="figleft illowp35">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_102.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>We were off the next morning before the sun was up. I walked with my
    mothers and the other women. The men went a little ahead, armed, some
    with guns, others with bows. Sacred-Red-Eagle-Wing walked behind the
    men. On his back I saw a handsome otter-skin quiver, full of arrows.
    I felt safer to see those arrows. Enemies might be lurking anywhere
    in the woods, ready to capture us or take our scalps. We Indian women
    dared not go far into the woods without men to protect us.</p>

  <p>At the woods the men joined us, and our party broke up into little
    groups, the older men helping their wives, and the younger men
    their sweethearts. I made my way to a clump of June berry trees
    bent nearly to the ground with fruit. I did not look to see if
    Sacred-Red-Eagle-Wing was following me. I thought, “If he wants to
    help me, he may; but I shall not ask him.” I spread a skin under the
    branches, and I was looking for a stout stick when I saw my boy friend
    breaking off the laden branches and piling them on the skin, ready to
    be beaten.</p>

  <p>I sat on the ground and with my stick beat off the berries.
    Sacred-Red-Eagle-Wing fetched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span> me fresh branches, and in an hour or two
    I had enough berries to fill my sack. Sacred-Red-Eagle-Wing’s arrows
    lay at my feet. Once, when a near-by bush stirred, my boy friend leaped
    for his bow and laid an arrow on the string; but it was the wind, I
    guess.</p>

  <div class="figright illowp47">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_103.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>All the time that we worked together Sacred-Red-Eagle-Wing and I spoke
    not a word. Older couples, I knew, talked together, when they thought
    of marrying; but I was a young girl yet and did not want to be bothered
    with a husband.</p>

  <p>When my sack was filled, I tied it shut and slung it on my back by my
    packing strap. Sacred-Red-Eagle-Wing laid some sweet smelling leaves
    under the sack that the juices from the ripe berries might not ooze
    through and stain my dress.</p>

  <p>I am sorry to say that I am not sure I even thanked
    Sacred-Red-Eagle-Wing for all he did to help me.</p>

  <p>I walked back to the village with the women as I had come. Ahead of us
    walked a young woman named Pink Blossom, with her chin in the air as
    if she were angry. The older women, coming after her, were laughing
    and slyly jesting with one another. I asked my mothers what it was all
    about.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span></p>

  <p>It seems there was an old man in our party named Old Bear, whose wife
    had died. He wanted to marry again and smiled at Pink Blossom whenever
    she passed him; but she did not like Old Bear, and she turned her eyes
    away whenever he came near.</p>

  <p>When she came to the June berry woods, Pink Blossom set her sack under
    a tree, while she picked berries. Old Bear saw the sack. He folded his
    robe under his arm into a kind of pocket, picked it full of berries,
    and emptied them into Pink Blossom’s sack.</p>

  <p>This vexed Pink Blossom. She went to her sack and poured Old Bear’s
    berries out on the ground. “I do not want that old man to smile at me,”
    she told the other women.</p>

  <p>It was because the women were laughing at her and Old Bear, that Pink
    Blossom walked ahead with her chin in the air. The others were having a
    good deal of fun with one another at her expense.</p>

  <p>“I think Pink Blossom did wrong to waste the berries,” said one, a clan
    cousin. “If she did not want them herself, she should have given them
    back to Old Bear, for him to eat.”</p>

  <p>“Old Bear’s is a sad case,” said Elk Woman. “But I knew a man in a
    worse case.”</p>

  <p>“Tell us of it,” said Red Blossom.</p>

  <p>“Years ago,” said Elk Woman, “I went berrying with some others on the
    other side of the Missouri. In the party was a young man named Weasel
    Arm. He was a good singer, and he liked to sing so that his sweetheart
    could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span> hear his voice. His sweetheart was also in the party. Weasel Arm
    helped her fill her sack; and when she went back with the other women
    and they were waiting for some that had not yet come in, Weasel Arm lay
    down on the grass a little way off and sang, beating time on the stock
    of his gun.</p>

  <p>“As he lay there he heard some one riding toward him, but thought it
    was one of his party. It was a Sioux; and right in the midst of the
    song—<i>poh!</i>—the Sioux fired, wounding Weasel Arm in the hip.
    Luckily the wound was slight, and Weasel Arm sprang for the near-by
    woods. The Sioux dared not follow him, for he saw that Weasel Arm had a
    gun.”</p>

  <p>“I do not think Weasel Arm’s case as sad as Old Bear’s,” said one of
    the women. “Weasel Arm was wounded in his body, but Old Bear is wounded
    in his heart.”</p>

  <p>Elk Woman laughed. “Have no fear for Old Bear,” she said. “He is an old
    man and has had more than one sweetheart. His heart will soon heal.”</p>

  <div class="figcenter illowp100">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_105.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>“But I am sorry for the spilled berries,” she continued. “Pink Blossom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
    should not waste good berries, even if Old Bear does look like an old
    man.”</p>

  <p>All laughed at this but Pink Blossom.</p>

  <p>“I knew a young woman who once wasted good rose berries, just as Pink
    Blossom wasted the June berries,” said Old-Owl Woman.</p>

  <p>“Tell us the story,” said one of my mothers.</p>

  <p>“When I was a girl,” said Old-Owl Woman, “Ear-Eat, a Crow Indian,
    married Yellow Blossom, a Hidatsa girl. They went to live with the
    Crows, but after a year they came back to visit our tribe at Five
    Villages.</p>

  <p>“It was in the fall, when the rose berries are ripe. Now the Crow
    Indians like to eat rose berries, and gather them to dry for winter as
    we dry squashes. We Hidatsas eat rose berries sometimes, but we never
    dry them for winter. We think they are food for wild men.</p>

  <p>“Ear-Eat was riding in the woods near our villages, when he found a
    thicket of rose bushes bending over with their load of ripe berries.
    ‘<i>Ey</i>,’ he cried, ‘how many berries are here! I never saw it thus
    in our Crow country.’ And he got off his horse and began to pick the
    berries.</p>

  <p>“He had no basket to put them in, so he drew off his leggings, tied the
    bottoms shut with his moccasin strings, and, when he had filled the
    leggings with berries, he slung them over his horse’s back like a pair
    of saddle bags.</p>

  <p>“He rode home happy, for he thought, ‘My wife will be glad to see so
    many berries.’</p>

  <p>“When Yellow Blossom saw her husband riding home without his leggings,
    and with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span> tops of his moccasins loose and flapping, she could
    hardly believe her eyes. As she stood staring, Ear-Eat got off his
    horse and handed her his bulging leggings. ‘Here, wife,’ he cried,
    ‘look at these fine berries. Now we shall have something good to eat.’</p>

  <p>“The village women, hearing what Ear-Eat said, crowded close to look.
    When they saw that his leggings were filled with rose berries, they
    cried out with laughter.</p>

  <p>“Yellow Blossom was angry. ‘You are crazy,’ she cried to her husband.
    ‘We Hidatsas raise corn, beans, sunflower seed, and good squashes to
    eat. We are not starving, that we must eat rose berries.’</p>

  <p>“‘The Crow Indians eat rose berries,’ said Ear-Eat. ‘My mother used to
    dry them for winter food.’</p>

  <p>“His words but vexed Yellow Blossom more.</p>

  <p>“‘I am a Hidatsa woman, not a Crow,’ she cried. ‘We Hidatsas are not
    wild people. We live in earth lodges and eat foods from our gardens.
    When we go berrying we put our berries into clean baskets, not into our
    leggings.’ And she turned the leggings up and poured the rose berries
    out on the ground.”</p>

  <p>We all laughed at Old-Owl Woman’s story.</p>

  <p>“We had other use for rose berries when I was a girl,” said Red
    Blossom. “If a young man went at evening to talk with his sweetheart,
    he put a ripe rose berry in his mouth to make his breath sweet.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span></p>

  <p>“I wonder if Old Bear put a rose berry in his mouth,” said Old-Owl
    Woman.</p>

  <p>“I think he put two rose berries in his mouth,” said Red Blossom,
    smiling.</p>

  <p>All laughed again but Pink Blossom; she walked on, saying nothing.</p>

    <div class="large mt2">TWELFTH CHAPTER</div>
    <h2 class="nobreak">THE CORN HUSKING</h2>
  </div>

  <p>After the June berry season came choke-cherries. We did not gather so
    big a store of these, but they were harder to prepare for drying. I
    can yet see old Turtle, with her gnarled, wrinkled fingers, plying the
    crushing stones. She dropped three or four cherries on a round stone
    and crushed them with a smaller stone held in her palm. The pulp she
    squeezed through her palms into lumps, which she dried in the sun.</p>

  <p>And then came the corn harvest, busiest and happiest time of all the
    year. It was hard work gathering and husking the corn, but what fun
    we had! For days we girls thought of nothing but the fine dresses we
    should wear at the husking.</p>

  <p>While the ears were ripening my sister and I went every morning to sit
    on our watch stage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span> and sing to the corn. One evening we brought home
    with us a basketful of the green ears and were husking them by the
    fire. My father gathered up the husks and took them out of the lodge. I
    wondered why he did so.</p>

  <p>“I fed the husks, daughter, to my pack horses,” he said, when he came
    back. “To-morrow I go hunting to get meat for the husking.” He had
    brought his hunting pony into the lodge, but he had penned his pack
    horses for the night under the corn stage.</p>

  <p>My two mothers, I knew, were planning a big feast. “We have much corn
    to husk,” they said, “and we must have plenty of food, for we do not
    want our huskers to go away hungry.”</p>

  <p>Small Ankle left us before daybreak. He returned the fourth day
    after, about noon, with two deer loaded on his pack horses. “One is
    a black-tail,” he told us when he came in the lodge, “a buck that I
    killed yesterday in some bad lands by the Little Missouri. He was
    hiding in a clump of trees. As I rode near, he winded me and ran out
    into the open. I checked my pony, and the buck stopped to look around.
    I fired, and he fell; but, when I got off my horse, the buck rose and
    tried to push me with his horns. I killed him with my knife.” A wounded
    black-tail often tried to fight off the hunters: a white-tail hardly
    ever did so.</p>

  <p>The next morning we women rose early, and with our baskets hastened to
    the cornfield. All day we plucked the ripe ears, bearing them in our
    baskets to the center of the field, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span> we laid them in a long pile.
    That night my father and Red Blossom slept on the watchers’ stage, to
    see that no horse broke in and trampled our corn pile. There was not
    much danger of this. Around the field ran a kind of fence, of willows,
    enough to keep out the ponies.</p>

  <div class="figright illowp53">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_111.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>The rest of us returned to the lodge to make ready for the feast the
    next day. Turtle fetched out three great bundles of dried buffalo meat
    and piled them on the puncheon bench with the freshly killed deer meat.
    Our three kettles were scoured and set by, ready to be taken to the
    field.</p>

  <p>At nightfall Bear’s Tail went around the village to lodges of our
    relatives and friends, and invited the young men to come to our husking.</p>

  <p>I was too excited that night to sleep much. Early in the morning my
    sister and I rose and went to the river for a dip in its cold waters.
    After a hasty breakfast I put on my best dress, of deer skin, with
    hoofs hanging like bangles at the edge of the skirt and three rows of
    costly elk teeth across the front. Cold Medicine helped me paint my
    face, and was careful to rub a little red ochre in the part of my hair.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

  <p>The sun was just coming over the prairie when we started for the field.
    We had loaded our kettles and meat on two pack horses, and old Turtle
    led the way. My father and Red Blossom had risen early and eaten
    breakfast, and now had a brisk fire going. We put our kettles on, after
    filling them with water. In one we put dried, in another fresh, meat;
    the third kettle we filled with green corn, late planted for this
    purpose. The meat and corn were for our feast.</p>

  <p>The sun was three hours high when the huskers came. They were about
    thirty in all, young men, except three or four crippled old warriors
    who wanted to feast. These were too old to work much, but my father
    made them welcome.</p>

  <p>The huskers came into the field yelling and singing. We had, indeed,
    heard their yells long before we saw them. I think young men all sing
    and yell, just because they are young.</p>

  <p>My sister and I were already seated at one side of the corn pile, and
    the other women joined us. The young men sat down on the opposite side,
    and the husking began.</p>

  <p>I saw that Sacred-Red-Eagle-Wing sat just opposite me. Next to him was
    a young man named Red Hand, with grass plumes in his hair. These meant
    that he had been in a war party and had been sent out to spy on the
    enemy. I saw Red Hand looking at me, and I was glad that I was wearing
    my elk teeth dress. “He is a young man,” I thought, “not a boy, like
    Sacred-Red-Eagle-Wing.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span></p>

  <p>The huskers worked rapidly, stripping off the dry husks with their
    hands. The big fine ears they braided in strings, to save for seed.
    Smaller ears they tossed into a pile. Big as our corn pile was, it was
    husked in about four hours.</p>

  <div class="figright illowp36">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_113.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>My mothers then served the feast. The huskers were hearty eaters; for,
    like all young men, they had good appetites; but we had a big feast of
    meat, and even they could not eat all. It was not polite to leave any
    of the food, and some had brought sharp sticks on which they skewered
    the meat they could not eat, to take home with them.</p>

  <p>The feast over, the huskers went to another field, singing and yelling
    as they went.</p>

  <p>We women had now to busy ourselves carrying in our corn.</p>

  <p>We loaded our two pack horses with strings of braided ears, ten strings
    to a pony. The smaller ears we bore to the village in our baskets, to
    dry on our corn stage before threshing.</p>

  <p>In midafternoon there were a few strings of corn still left, and I was
    laying them by for the next trip when I heard steps. I looked up and
    saw Red Hand coming, leading his pony.</p>

  <p>Red Hand did not speak, but he laid my strings of corn on his pony and
    started for the village. “He wants to help me take home my corn,” I
    thought. A young man did thus for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span> the girl he admired. “Red Hand is
    brave, and he owns a pony,” I said to myself; and I forgot all about
    Sacred-Red-Eagle-Wing.</p>

  <p>My father returned with the pack horses just as Red Hand was starting
    off; and I was stooping to fill my basket, when suddenly there came
    a sound, <i>poh-poh-poh</i>, as of guns; then yells, and a woman
    screamed. Small Ankle sprang for his war pony, which he had left
    hobbled near the husking pile.</p>

  <p>Our corn fields lay in a strip of flat land skirted by low foot hills;
    and now I saw, coming over the hills, a party of Sioux, thirty or
    more, mounted, and painted for war. At the edge of the hills they
    checked their ponies, and those who had guns began firing down into our
    gardens. Many of the Sioux were armed with bows and arrows.</p>

  <p>On all sides arose outcries. My brave father dashed by with his ringing
    war whoop, <i>ui, ui, ui</i>;<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and after him Red Hand, lashing his
    pony and yelling like mad. Red Hand had thrown away my strings of corn,
    but I was not thinking of my corn just then.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22">[22]</a> ṳ ï (pronounced like ōō ēē, but quickly and sharply)
  </div>

  <p>Women and children began streaming past our field to the village. Brave
    young men rode between them and our enemies, lest the Sioux dash down
    and cut off some straggler. Two lads, on swift ponies, galloped ahead
    to rouse the villagers.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile my father and others were fighting off the Sioux from the
    shelter of some clumps of small trees that dotted the flat: Our enemies
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>did not fight standing, but galloped and pranced their horses about on
    the hillside to spoil our aim.
  </p>

  <div class="figcenter illowp100">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_115.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>Suddenly a Sioux warrior, in trailing eagle-feather bonnet, and mounted
    on a beautiful spotted pony, dashed down the hillside toward us, waving
    his bow over his head; and from our side I saw Red Hand, gun in hand,
    riding to meet him.</p>

  <p>As they drew near one another the Sioux swerved, and an arrow, like a
    little snake, came curving through the air. Red Hand’s pony stumbled
    and fell, the shaft in its throat; but Red Hand, leaping to the ground,
    raised his gun and fired. I saw the Sioux drop his bow and ride back
    clinging desperately to his pony’s mane. Red Hand put his hand to his
    mouth and I heard his <i>yi-yi-yi-yi-yah</i>,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> the yell that a
    warrior made when he had wounded an enemy.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23">[23]</a> yĭ yĭ yĭ yĭ yäh´
  </div>

  <p>On the side toward our village other cries now arose, for the warriors
    were coming to our help. The Sioux fled. Our men pursued them, and at
    nightfall came back with one scalp.</p>

  <p>All that night we danced the scalp dance. A big fire was built. Men and
    women painted <span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>their faces black and sang glad songs. Old women cried
    <i>a-la-la-la-la!</i><a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Young men danced, yelled and boasted of their
    deeds. All said that Red Hand was a brave young man and would become a
    great warrior.</p>

  <p>The next day I was coming from the watering place with my kettle. Just
    ahead of me walked Waving Corn, a handsome girl two years older than I.
    Red Hand passed by; shyly I looked up, thinking to see him smile at me.</p>

  <p>He was smiling at Waving Corn.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak">MARRIAGE</h2>
  </div>

  <p>And so I grew up, a happy, contented Indian girl, obedient to my
    mothers, but loving them dearly. I learned to cook, dress skins,
    embroider, sew with awl and sinew, and cut and make moccasins, clothing
    and tent covers. There was always plenty of work to do, but I had time
    to rest, and to go to see my friends; and I was not given tasks beyond
    my strength. My father did the heavy lifting, if posts or beams were
    to be raised. “You are young, daughter,” he would say. “Take care you
    do not overstrain!” He was a kind man, and helped my mothers and me
    whenever we had hard work to do.</p>

  <p>For my industry in dressing skins, my clan aunt, Sage, gave me a
    woman’s belt. It was as broad as my three fingers, and covered with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
    blue beads. One end was made long, to hang down before me. Only a very
    industrious girl was given such a belt. She could not buy or make one.
    No relative could give her the belt; for a clan aunt, remember, was not
    a blood relative. To wear a woman’s belt was an honor. I was as proud
    of mine as a war leader of his first scalp.</p>

  <p>I won other honors by my industry. For embroidering a robe for my
    father with porcupine quills I was given a brass ring, bought of the
    traders; and for embroidering a tent cover with gull quills dyed yellow
    and blue I was given a bracelet. There were few girls in the village
    who owned belt, ring and bracelet.</p>

  <p>In these years of my girlhood my mothers were watchful of all that I
    did. We had big dances in the village, when men and women sang, drums
    beat loud, and young men, painted and feathered, danced and yelled to
    show their brave deeds. I did not go to these dances often, and, when
    I did, my mothers went with me. Ours was one of the better families of
    the tribe, and my mothers were very careful of me.</p>

  <p>I was eighteen years old the Bent-Enemy-Killed winter; for we Hidatsas
    reckoned by winters, naming each for something that happened in it. An
    old man named Hanging Stone then lived in the village. He had a stepson
    named Magpie, a handsome young man and a good hunter.</p>

  <p>One morning Hanging Stone came into our lodge. It was a little while
    after our morning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span> meal, and I was putting away the wooden bowls that
    we used for dishes. The hollow buffalo hoofs hung on the door for
    bells, I remember, rattled clitter, clitter, clitter, as he raised and
    let fall the door. My father was sitting by the fire.</p>

  <p>Hanging Stone walked up to my father, and laid his right hand on my
    father’s head. “I want you to believe what I say,” he cried. “I want my
    boy to live in your good family. I am poor, you are rich; but I want
    you to favor us and do as I ask.”</p>

  <p>He went over to my mothers and did likewise, speaking the same words to
    both. He then strode out of the lodge.</p>

  <p>Neither my father nor my mothers said anything, and I did not know at
    first what it all meant. My father sat for a while, looking at the
    fire. At last he spoke, “My daughter is too young to marry. When she is
    older I may be willing.”</p>

  <p>Toward evening Hanging Stone and his relatives brought four horses and
    three flint-lock guns to our lodge. He tied the four horses to the
    drying stage outside. They had good bridles, with chains hanging to the
    bits. On the back of each horse was a blanket and some yards of calico,
    very expensive in those days.</p>

  <p>Hanging Stone came into the lodge. “I have brought you four horses and
    three guns,” he said to my father.</p>

  <p>“I must refuse them,” answered Small Ankle. “My daughter is too young
    to marry.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span></p>

  <p>Hanging Stone went away, but he did not take his horses with him. My
    father sent them back by some young men.</p>

  <p>The evening of the second day after, Hanging Stone came again to our
    lodge. As before, he brought the three guns and gifts of cloth, and
    four horses; but two of these were hunting horses. A hunting horse was
    one fleet enough to overtake a buffalo, a thing that few of our little
    Indian ponies could do. Such horses were costly and hard to get. A
    family that had good hunting horses had always plenty of meat.</p>

  <p>After Hanging Stone left, my father said to his wives, “What do you
    think about it?”</p>

  <p>“We would rather not say anything,” they answered. “Do as you think
    best.”</p>

  <p>“I know this Magpie,” said my father. “He is a kind young man. I have
    refused his gifts once, but I see his heart is set on having our
    daughter. I think I shall agree to it.”</p>

  <p>Turning to me he spoke: “My daughter, I have tried to raise you right.
    I have hunted and worked hard to give you food to eat. Now I want you
    to take my advice. Take this man for your husband. Try always to love
    him. Do not think in your heart, ‘I am a handsome young woman, but this
    man, my husband, is older and not handsome.’ Never taunt your husband.
    Try not to do anything that will make him angry.”</p>

  <p>I did not answer <i>yes</i> or <i>no</i> to this; for I thought, “If my
    father wishes me to do this, why that is the best thing for me to do.”
    I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span> had been taught to be obedient to my father. I do not think white
    children are taught so, as we Indian children were taught.</p>

  <div class="figright illowp58">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_121.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>For nigh a week my father and my two mothers were busy getting ready
    the feast foods for the wedding. On the morning of the sixth day, my
    father took from his bag a fine weasel-skin cap and an eagle-feather
    war bonnet. The first he put on my head; the second he handed to my
    sister, Cold Medicine. “Take these to Hanging Stone’s lodge,” he said.</p>

  <p>We were now ready to march. I led, my sister walking with me. Behind
    us came some of our relatives, leading three horses; and, after them,
    five great kettles of feast foods, on poles borne on the shoulders of
    women relatives. The kettles held boiled dried green corn and ripe corn
    pounded to meal and boiled with beans; and they were steaming hot.</p>

  <p>There was a covered entrance to Hanging Stone’s lodge. The light was
    rather dim inside, and I did not see a dog lying there until he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span> sprang
    up, barking <i>wu-wu!</i> and dashed past me. I sprang back, startled.
    Cold Medicine tittered. “Do not be foolish,” called one of our women
    relatives. Cold Medicine stopped her tittering, but I think we were
    rather glad of the dog. My sister and I had never marched in a wedding
    before, and we were both a little scared.</p>

  <div class="figleft illowp56">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_122.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>I lifted the skin door—it was an old-fashioned one swinging on thongs
    from the beam overhead—and entered the lodge. Hanging Stone sat on
    his couch against the puncheon fire screen. I went to him and put the
    weasel-skin cap on his head. The young man who was to be my husband was
    sitting on his couch, a frame of poles covered with a tent skin. Cold
    Medicine and I went over and shyly sat on the floor near-by.</p>

  <p>The kettles of feast foods had been set down near the fireplace, and
    the three horses tied to the corn stage without. Hanging Stone had
    fetched my father four horses. We reckoned the weasel cap and the war
    bonnet as worth each a horse; and, with these and our three horses, my
    father felt he was going his friend one horse better. It was a point
    of honor in an Indian family for the bride’s father to make a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>more
    valuable return gift than that brought him by the bridegroom and his
    friends.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illowp64">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_123.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>
  <div class="caption">Plate II.—“I put the weasel-skin cap on his head.”</div>

  <p>As we two girls sat on the floor, with ankles to the right, as Indian
    women always sit, Magpie’s mother filled a wooden bowl with dried
    buffalo meat pounded fine and mixed with marrow fat, and set it for my
    sister and me to eat. We ate as much as we could. What was left, my
    sister put in a fold of her robe, and we arose and went home. It would
    have been impolite to leave behind any of the food given us to eat.</p>

  <p>Later in the day Magpie’s relatives and friends came to feast on the
    foods we had taken to Hanging Stone’s lodge. Each guest brought a gift,
    something useful to a new-wed bride—beaded work, fawn-skin work bag,
    girl’s leggings, belt, blanket, woman’s robe, calico for a dress, and
    the like. In the evening two women of Magpie’s family brought these
    gifts to my father’s lodge, packing them each in a blanket on her back.
    They piled the gifts on the floor beside Red Blossom, the elder of my
    two mothers.</p>

  <p>Red Blossom spent the next few days helping me build and decorate the
    couch that was to mark off the part of our lodge set apart for my
    husband and me. We even made and placed before the couch a fine, roomy
    lazy-back, or willow chair.</p>

  <p>All being now ready, Red Blossom said to me: “Go and call your husband.
    Go and sit beside him and say, ‘I want you to come to my father’s
    lodge.’ Do not feel shy. Go boldly and have no fear.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span></p>

  <p>So with my sister I slowly walked to Hanging Stone’s lodge. There were
    several besides the family within, for they were expecting me; but no
    one said anything as we entered.</p>

  <p>Magpie was sitting on his couch, for this in the daytime was used as
    white men use a lounge or a big chair. My sister and I went over and
    sat beside him. Magpie smiled and said, “What have you come for?”</p>

  <p>“I have come to call you,” I answered.</p>

  <p>“<i>Sukkeets</i>—good!” he said.</p>

  <p>Cold Medicine and I arose and returned to my father’s lodge. Magpie
    followed us a few minutes later; for young men did not walk through the
    village with their sweethearts in the daytime. We should have thought
    that foolish.</p>

  <p>And so I was wed.</p>

    <div class="large mt2">FOURTEENTH CHAPTER</div>
    <h2 class="nobreak">A BUFFALO HUNT</h2>
  </div>

  <p>My young husband and I lived together but a few years. He died of lung
    sickness; and, after I had mourned a year, I married Son-of-a-Star, a
    Mandan. My family wished me to marry again; for, while an Indian woman
    could raise corn for herself and family, she could not hunt to get meat
    and skins.</p>

  <p>Son-of-a-Star was a kind man, and my father liked him. “He is brave,
    daughter,” Small Ankle said. “He wears two eagle feathers, for he has
    twice struck an enemy, and he has danced the death dance. Three times
    he has shot an arrow through a buffalo.” It was not easy to shoot an
    arrow through a buffalo and few of my tribe had done so.</p>

  <p>Spring had come, and in the moon of Breaking Ice we returned to
    Like-a-Fishhook village. Our hunters had not killed many deer the
    winter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span> before, and our stores of corn were getting low. As ours was
    a large family, Son-of-a-Star thought he would join a hunting party
    that was going up the river for buffaloes. “Even if we do not find much
    game,” he said, “we shall kill enough for ourselves. We younger men
    should not be eating the corn and beans that old men and children need.”</p>

  <p>Small Ankle thought the plan a good one. I was glad also, for I was to
    be one of the party. Corn planting time would not come for a month yet;
    and, after the weeks in our narrow winter quarters, I longed to be out
    again in the fresh air.</p>

  <p>There were ten in the party besides Son-of-a-Star and myself:
    Crow-Flies-High, Bad Brave, High Backbone, Long Bear, and Scar, and
    their wives. Scar was a Teton Sioux who had come to visit us.</p>

  <p>My tribe now owned many horses, and fewer dogs were used than when I
    was a little girl. A party of buffalo hunters usually took both hunting
    and pack horses; but our village herd was weak and poor in flesh after
    the scant winter’s feeding, and we thought it better to take only dogs.
    There was yet little pasture, and the ground was wet and spongy from
    the spring thaws. Only a strong, well-fed pony could go all day on wet
    ground.</p>

  <p>I took three of our family dogs. On the travois of two I loaded robes
    for bedding, the halves of an old tent cover, moccasins for myself and
    husband, an ax, a copper kettle and a flesher for dressing hides. My
    third dog dragged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span> a bull boat, bound mouth down to the travois poles.
    We planned to return by way of the river, in boats.</p>

  <p>We were clad warmly, for the weather was chill. All had robes. I wore a
    dress of two deer skins sewed edge to edge; the hind legs, thus sewed,
    made the sleeves for my arms.</p>

  <div class="figright illowp48">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_129.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>I had made my husband a fine skin shirt, embroidered with beads. Over
    it he drew his robe, fur side in. He spread his feet apart, drew the
    robe high enough to cover his head, and folded it, tail end first, over
    his right side; then the head end over his left, and belted the robe in
    place. He spread his feet apart when belting, to give the robe a loose
    skirt for walking in.</p>

  <p>We all wore winter moccasins, fur lined, with high tops. The men
    carried guns. Buffalo hunters no longer used bows except from horseback.</p>

  <p>We started off gaily, in a long line. Each woman was followed by her
    dogs. Two women, having no dogs, packed their camp stuff on their backs.</p>

  <p>We made our first camp late in the afternoon, at a place called
    Timber-Faces-across-River. There was a spring here, of good water.
    Crow-Flies-High and Bad Brave went hunting,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span> while we women pitched
    our tent. We cut forked poles and stacked them with tops together
    like a tepee. We covered this frame with skins, laced together at
    the edges with thongs. A rawhide lariat was drawn around the outside
    of the cover; and small logs, laid about the edges, held the tent to
    the ground. We could not use tent pins, for the ground was frozen.
    We raised an old saddle skin on the windward side of the smoke hole,
    staying it with a forked pole, thrust through a hole in the edge. We
    were some time building, as the tent had to be large enough for twelve
    persons.</p>

  <p>We finished just at dusk; and we were starting a fire inside, when the
    two hunters came in. Each packed on his back the side and ham of an
    elk they had killed. Bad Brave had laid a pad of dry grass across his
    shoulders that the meat juice might not stain his robe.</p>

  <p>It was getting dark, and, while we women gathered dry grass for our
    beds, the two hunters roasted one of the sides of meat. They skewered
    it on a stick and swung it from the drying pole. Standing on each side,
    the two men swung the meat slowly, forth and back, over the fire.</p>

  <p>We were all hungry when we sat down to eat. The fresh roasted ribs of
    the elk were juicy and sweet, and with full stomachs we felt sleepy,
    for the day’s march had been long. We gladly spread our robes and crept
    into our beds, first covering a coal with ashes for the morning fire.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span></p>

  <div class="figright illowp53">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_131.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>Next morning we had struck our tent and loaded our dogs before the sun
    was well up. We took only the tent cover, leaving the poles. Three
    of our men went ahead to hunt. The rest followed more slowly, not to
    tire our dogs. Now and then we stopped to rest and eat from our lunch
    bags. These were of dried buffalo heart skins. Every woman in the party
    carried one of them tucked under her belt. We had been careful to fill
    our bags with cooked meat, from our breakfast.</p>

  <p>My husband walked at my side if he talked with me. At other times he
    went a little ahead; for, if enemies or a grizzly attacked us, he would
    thus be in front, ready to fight, giving me time to escape.</p>

  <p>Our trail led along the brow of the bluffs overlooking the Missouri.
    There was a path here, fairly well marked, made by hunting parties, and
    perhaps by buffaloes.</p>

  <p>Our second camp was at a place called the Slides; for, here, big blocks
    of earth, softened by the spring rains, sometimes slide down the bank
    into the river. We found a spring a little way in from the river, with
    small trees that we could cut for tent poles.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span></p>

  <div class="figleft illowp42">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_132.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>Our tent was hardly pitched when Son-of-a-Star and Scar came in to say
    they had killed a stray buffalo not far away. They had packed part of
    the meat to camp on their shoulders, and Son-of-a-Star had cut out the
    buffalo’s paunch and filled it with fresh blood. While the two hunters
    went back for the rest of the meat, I put on my copper kettle and made
    blood pudding. It was hot and ready to serve by the time they came
    back. I had stirred the pudding with a green chokecherry stick, giving
    it a pleasant, cherry flavor.</p>

  <p>We were a jolly party as we sat around the evening fire. The hot
    pudding felt good in our stomachs, after the long march. My good dogs,
    Knife-Carrier, Took-a-Scalp, and Packs-a-Babe, I had fed with scraps
    of meat from the dead buffalo, and they were dozing outside, snuggled
    against the tent to keep warm. <i>Okeemeea</i>,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Crow-Flies-High’s
    wife, fetched in some dry wood, which she put on the fire. A yellow
    blaze lit up the tent and a column of thin, blue smoke rose upward to
    the smoke hole.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25">[25]</a> O kēē mēē´ ä
  </div>

  <p>Crow-Flies-High filled his pipe and passed it among the men. Hidatsa
    women do not smoke.</p>

  <p>In the morning, on the way up, we had forded a stream we call Rising
    Water creek. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>My leggings and moccasins were still wet; and, as I was
    wringing them out to dry over the fire, I said to High Backbone’s
    wife Blossom: “That creek is dangerous. As I was fording it to-day, I
    slipped in the mud and nearly fell in; but I once got a good dinner out
    of that mud.”</p>

  <p>“How did you get a dinner out of mud?” asked Blossom.</p>

  <p>“I will tell you,” I answered. “I was a young girl then. My tribe
    had come up the river to hunt buffaloes and we had stopped at Rising
    Water Creek to make fires and eat our midday meal. It was summer and
    the creek was low, for there had been little rain. Some little girls
    went down for water. They came running back, much frightened. ‘We saw
    something move in the mud of the creek,’ they cried. ‘It is alive!’</p>

  <p>“We ran to the bank of the creek and, sure enough, something that
    looked as big as a man was struggling and floundering in a pool. The
    water was roiled and thick with mud.</p>

  <p>“We could not think what it could be. Some thought it was an enemy
    trying to hide in the mud.</p>

  <p>“A brave young man named Skunk threw off his leggings, drew his knife,
    and waded out to the thing. Suddenly he stooped, and in a moment
    started to land with the thing in his arms. It was a great fish, a
    sturgeon. It had a smooth back, like a catfish. We cut up the flesh and
    boiled it. It tasted sweet, like catfish flesh. I do not remember if we
    drank the broth, as we do when we boil catfish.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span></p>

  <div class="figleft illowp56">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_134.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>“I have seen those fish,” said Bad Brave. “Sometimes when the Missouri
    falls after the spring floods, one of them will be left stranded on the
    sand; but I never knew one to be seen in Rising Water creek. I know
    that turtles are found there, the big kind that fight.”</p>

  <p>“I have heard that white men eat turtles,” said Long Bear’s wife. “I do
    not believe it.”</p>

  <p>“They do eat turtles,” said High Backbone, “and they eat frogs. A white
    man told me. I asked him.”</p>

  <p>“<i>Ey!</i> And such unclean things; I could not eat them,” cried Bird
    Woman.</p>

  <p>“There are big turtles in our Dakota lakes,” said Scar. “They are so
    big that they drag under the water buffaloes that come there to drink.
    I once heard a story of a magic turtle.”</p>

  <p>“Tell us the story,” said Son-of-a-Star.</p>

  <p>“A brave young Dakota led out a war party, of six men,” began Scar.
    “They came into the Chippewa country and wandered about, seeking to
    strike an enemy. They found deserted camps, sometimes with ashes in the
    fire pit still warm; but they found no enemies.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span></p>

  <p>“One day they came to a beautiful lake. On the shore, close to the
    water, was a grassy knoll, rising upward like the back of a great
    turtle.</p>

  <p>“The leader of the party had now begun to lose heart. ‘We have found no
    enemy,’ he said. ‘I think the gods are angry with us. We should return
    home. If we do not, harm may come to us.’</p>

  <p>“‘Let us rest by this knoll,’ said one. ‘When we have smoked, we will
    start back home.’</p>

  <p>“They had smoked but one pipe when the leader said, ‘I think we should
    go now. There is something strange about this knoll. Somehow, I think
    it is alive.’</p>

  <p>“There was a young man in the party, reckless and full of life, whom
    the others called the Mocker. He sprang up crying, ‘Let us see if it is
    alive. Come on, we will dance on the knoll.’</p>

  <p>“‘No,’ said the leader, ‘an evil spirit may be in the knoll. The hill
    may be but the spirit’s body. It is not wise to mock the gods.’</p>

  <p>“‘<i>Hwee</i><a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>—come on! Who is afraid?’ cried the Mocker. He ran to
    the top of the knoll, and three of the party followed him laughing.
    They leaped and danced and called to the others, ‘What do you fear?’</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26">[26]</a> Hwēē
  </div>

  <p>“Suddenly the knoll began to shake. It put out legs. It began to move
    toward the lake. It was a huge turtle.</p>

  <p>“‘Help, help!’ cried the Mocker. He and his friends tried to escape.
    They could not. Some power held their feet fast to the turtle’s back,
    so that they could not move.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span></p>

  <p>“The great turtle plunged in the lake. The men were never seen again.”</p>

  <div class="figleft illowp68">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_136.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>There was silence when Scar ended. Then Crow-Flies-High spoke: “Those
    men were foolish. One should never make mock of the spirits.” He
    paused, puffing at his pipe and blowing great clouds from his nostrils.
    “I know a story of another Dakota who came to grief at a lake,” he
    continued, as he passed the burning pipe for my husband to smoke.</p>

  <p>“What is the story?” said Scar, smiling.</p>

  <p>“We Hidatsas,” said Crow-Flies-High, “believe that all babies born in
    our tribe have lived in another life. Some have lived in hills we call
    Babes’ Lodges. Others have lived as birds or beasts or even plants.</p>

  <p>“Down near the Dakota country is a lake. It is magic; and in old times
    young men went there to see what they had been in a former life. If one
    got up early in the morning while the lake was smooth, and looked in
    the water, he saw in his shadow the shadow also of what he had been.
    Some found this to be a bird, others a plant, as a flower or a squash.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span></p>

  <p>“A Dakota Indian had married a Hidatsa woman, and dwelt with our tribe.
    He was a good man, but he had a sharp tongue. He often got angry and
    said bitter words to his wife. When his anger had gone, he felt sorry
    for his words. ‘I do not know why I have such a sharp tongue,’ he would
    say.</p>

  <div class="figright illowp47">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_137.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>“One day, when hunting with some Hidatsas, he came near the magic lake.
    ‘I am going to see what I was before I became a babe,’ he told the
    others. In the morning he went to the lake, leaned over and looked. In
    his shadow he saw what he had been. It was a thorn bush.</p>

  <p>“With heavy heart, he came back to camp. ‘Now I know why I have a sharp
    tongue,’ he cried. ‘It is because I was a thorn bush. All my life I
    shall speak sharp words, like thorns.’”</p>

  <p>All laughed at Crow-Flies-High’s story, none more than Scar himself. “I
    am sure <i>I</i> was never a thorn bush,” he said, “for I speak sweet
    words to my wife, even when she scolds me.”</p>

  <p>“Hey, listen to the man!” cried his wife.</p>

  <p>“But stop talking, you men,” she continued, as she reached for a piece
    of bark to use as a shovel. “It is time to sleep, for we must be up
    early in the morning.” And she began to cover the fire with ashes.</p>

    <div class="large mt2">FIFTEENTH CHAPTER</div>
    <h2 class="nobreak">THE HUNTING CAMP</h2>
  </div>

  <p>We were up the next morning before the sun, and, after a hasty
    breakfast, the men went out to look for buffaloes. “The one we killed
    yesterday may have strayed from a herd,” Son-of-a-Star said. He was
    hopeful that they might find the herd near.</p>

  <p>We women were getting dinner when the men returned, having seen no
    buffaloes. I had cut a green stick with prongs, on which I spread
    slices of fresh buffalo steak, and held them over the fire to broil. I
    had three juicy steaks, steaming hot, lying on a little pile of clean
    grass, when my husband came in. “<i>Sukkeets</i>—good!” he cried; and
    he had eaten all three steaks before I had the fourth well warmed
    through.</p>

  <p>After dinner we broke camp and went on about five miles to Shell Creek
    Lake. In the afternoon of the following day we reached Deep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span> Creek. We
    pitched our tent on a bit of rising ground from which we scraped the
    wet snow with a hoe. The weather was getting warmer. Ice had broken on
    the Missouri the day we killed the stray buffalo.</p>

  <p>While we women busied ourselves with things in camp, the men went to
    hunt, and five miles farther on they discovered a herd of buffaloes
    crossing the Missouri from the south side. Our hunters, creeping close
    on the down-wind side, shot five fat cows as they landed. Buffaloes are
    rather stupid animals, but have keen scent. Had our hunters tried to
    come at them from the windward side, the herd would have winded them a
    half mile away. As it was, no more buffaloes crossed after the shots
    were fired, and some that were in the water swam back to the other
    side. A rifle shot at the Missouri’s edge will echo between the bluffs
    like a crash of thunder.</p>

  <p>The hunters found an elm tree with low hanging branches, and under it
    they built a rude stage. Meat and skins of the slain buffaloes they
    laid on the floor of the stage, out of reach of wolves. Some of the
    meat they hung on the branches of the elm.</p>

  <p>Son-of-a-Star brought back two hams and a tongue. I sliced the tough
    outer meat from the hams, to feed to my dogs. The bones, with the
    tender, inner meat, I laid on stones, around the fireplace, to roast,
    turning them now and then to keep the meat from scorching. The roasted
    meat we stripped off, and cracked the hot bones for the rich, yellow
    marrow.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span></p>

  <p>The next morning Crow-Flies-High called a council, and we decided to
    cross over to the other side of the river. “The main herd is there,”
    said Crow-Flies-High. “We should hunt the buffaloes before they move to
    other pasture.” We thought he spoke wisely, and men and women seized
    axes to cut a road through the willows for our travois.</p>

  <p>These we now loaded. The dogs dragged them to the water’s edge and
    we made ready to cross. There were two other bull boats in the party
    besides my own.</p>

  <p>My husband helped me load my boat, and we pushed off, our three dogs
    swimming after us. We had bound our travois to the tail of the boat,
    one upon the other. The long runners dragged in the water, but the
    travois baskets, raised to the boat’s edge, were hardly wetted.</p>

  <p>We landed, and I lent my boat to Scar to bring over his wife and her
    camp stuff. Our whole party crossed and brought over their goods in two
    trips.</p>

  <p>We packed our goods up the bank and made camp. While we women were
    cutting poles for our tent, we heard the men disputing. They were
    seated in a circle near our pile of goods. High Backbone had lighted a
    pipe.</p>

  <p>“I say we should go across the river and get the meat we staged
    yesterday,” said Crow-Flies-High. Others said, “No, there is better
    hunting on this side. Let us go at once and find the herd.” And all
    took their guns and hastened off but High Backbone, who stayed to
    guard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span> the camp. We were afraid enemies might also be following the
    herd.</p>

  <p>But the hunters returned at evening without having seen buffalo sign,
    and hungry—so hungry that they ate up half our store of meat. After
    supper, Crow-Flies-High called them to another council. “I told you we
    should get the meat we staged,” he said. “The gods gave us that meat.
    We should not waste it.”</p>

  <p>We recrossed the river the next morning and fetched back most of the
    staged meat and skins, reaching camp again in the early part of the
    afternoon. Too busy to stop and eat, we spent the rest of the day
    building stages and staking out the green hides to dry.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illowp100">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_141.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>The next day we found to our joy that the wind had shifted to the west.
    Our stages were now hung with slices of drying meat, and we had built
    slow fires beneath. An east wind would have carried the smoke toward
    the herd and stampeded it.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span></p>

  <div class="figleft illowp35">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_142.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>It was evening and getting dusk when Son-of-a-Star came into the tent,
    saying, “Buffaloes are on a bluff a quarter of a mile up the river. I
    can see them moving against the sky line.” We listened and heard the
    bulls roaring; so we knew a herd was coming in.</p>

  <p>We were careful to chop no wood that evening, nor do anything to make
    a noise. We smothered our fires, and we fed our dogs; for, with gorged
    stomachs, they would be sleepy and not bark. If a dog stirred in the
    night, one of us went out and quieted him.</p>

  <p>We made another crossing the next morning to fetch over the last of the
    meat we had staged. We returned about noon. The first woman to climb
    the bank under our camp was Scar’s wife, Blossom. She dropped her pack
    and came running back, her hands at each side of her head with two
    fingers crooked, like horns, the sign for buffaloes.</p>

  <p>We hastened into camp and saw the buffaloes a quarter of a mile away,
    swarming over a bluff. There was a bit of bad-land formation below,
    round-topped buttes with grassy stretches between. In these lower
    levels the sun had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span> started the grass, and I think the buffaloes were
    coming down into them to seek pasture.</p>

  <p>Our hunters had come up from the boats, guns in hand, and set off at
    once, creeping up the coulees from the lee side, that the buffaloes
    might not wind them. Presently I saw a flash and a puff of smoke; then
    another, and another; and the reports came echoing down the river
    basin, <i>poh—poh—poh—poh, poh, poh!</i> like thunder, away off. The
    herd took to their heels. Buffaloes, when alarmed, usually run up-wind;
    but, as the wind had shifted again to the east, this would have taken
    the herd into the river; so they swerved off and went tearing away
    toward the north.</p>

  <p>The hunters returned before evening. Son-of-a-Star was the first to
    come in. “I shot two fat cows,” he cried. “I have cut up the meat and
    put it in a pile, covered with the skins.” He had brought back the
    choice cuts, however, the tongues, kidneys and hams. We ate the kidneys
    raw.</p>

  <p>In the morning we harnessed our dogs and went out to the butchering
    place. As we neared my husband’s meat pile, I saw that he had driven
    a stick into the ground and tied his headcloth to it, like a flag.
    This was to keep away the wolves. There were many of them in the
    Missouri-river country then.</p>

  <p>While the flag fluttered and they winded the human smell, wolves would
    not touch the meat pile.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span></p>

  <p>Sometimes in the fall, when hunters were cutting up a dead buffalo, I
    have seen wolves, coyotes, and foxes, a half hundred maybe, stalking
    about or seated just out of bow shot, awaiting the time the hunters
    left. All then rushed in to gorge on the offal. The wolves often
    snarled and bit at one another as they ate.</p>

  <p>All these animals were great thieves; but the kit foxes, I think, were
    boldest. I was once with a hunting party, sleeping at night in a tent,
    when I awoke, hearing some one scream. A kit fox had stolen into the
    tent and walked over the bare face of one of the sleeping women. She
    was terribly vexed. “That bad fox stepped his foot in my mouth,” she
    cried angrily. In the morning we found the fox had made off with some
    of our meat.</p>

  <p>Son-of-a-Star uncovered his meat pile, and helped me load our travois,
    binding each load to its basket with thongs. By long use I knew how
    heavy a load each of my dogs was able to drag. When I thought the
    travois held enough, I lifted its poles and tried the weight with my
    hands.</p>

  <p>My husband and I packed loads on our own backs. Mine, I remember, was a
    whole green buffalo cow skin, a side of ribs and a tongue. This was a
    heavy load for a woman, and my husband scolded me roundly when we came
    in to camp. “That is foolish,” he said. “You will hurt your back.” I
    liked to work, however, and I wanted to show the older women how much I
    could carry.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span></p>

  <div class="figright illowp62">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_145.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>We remained in the camp about ten days. The men would hunt until they
    made a kill. Then we harnessed our dogs, and all went out to fetch in
    the meat. To do this took us about half a day. At other times, when not
    drying meat, we women busied ourselves making bull boats, to freight
    our meat down the river.</p>

  <p>I have said that I had brought one boat up from the village on one of
    my dogs. I now made another. There were some <i>mahoheesha</i> willows
    growing near the camp. I made the boat frame of these, covering it with
    the green hide of a buffalo cow. <i>Mahoheesha</i> willows are light,
    tough, and bend to any shape. They make good boat ribs.</p>

  <p>When ready to move camp, I carried my new boat down to the river,
    turned over my head like a big hat. At the water’s edge I drove a stout
    stake into the mud, and to this I fastened the floating boat with a
    short thong.</p>

  <p>Skins and dried meat had been made up into small bales. I packed these
    to the boat on my back, using a two-banded packing strap. As the river
    was not far from our camp and the bank not very steep, I did not think
    this task a hard one.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span></p>

  <p>When the boat was filled, I covered the load neatly with a piece of
    old tent skin, and to the tail of the boat, I lashed my three travois.
    The buffalo skin covering a bull boat was so laid that the tail was
    to the rear of the boat. For this reason we often spoke of the boat’s
    <i>head</i> and <i>tail</i>.
  </p>

  <div class="figleft illowp12">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_146.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>Meanwhile, Son-of-a-Star fetched the boat I had brought up from the
    village, and I bound it to the head of my newer boat. We were now ready
    to embark. I waded out, climbed into the empty, or passenger, boat, and
    called to my dogs. They leaped in beside me.</p>

  <p>Son-of-a-Star took off his moccasins and rolled up his leggings. He
    handed me his gun, loosed the thong that bound the boats to the stake,
    pushed the boats into deeper water, and climbed in. I handed him his
    paddle.</p>

  <p>I had hewn this paddle from a cottonwood log, only the day before. My
    own, lighter and better made, I had brought with me from the village.
    Each paddle had a large hole cut in the center of the blade. Without
    this hole, a paddle wobbled in the current.</p>

  <p>On the front of my paddle blade, Son-of-a-Star had painted a part of
    his war record, hoof prints as of a pony, and moccasin tracks such as
    a man makes with his right foot. Hoof and footprints had each a wound
    mark, as of flowing blood. Son-of-a-Star had drawn these marks with his
    finger, dipped in warm buffalo fat and red ochre.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span></p>

  <p>The marks were for a brave deed of my husband. He once rode against a
    party of Sioux, firing his gun, when a bullet went through his right
    thigh, and killed his horse. The footprints with the wound marks meant
    that Son-of-a-Star had been shot in his right leg.</p>

  <p>On his own paddle my husband had marked a cross within bars. These
    meant, “I was one of four warriors to count <i>strike</i> on an enemy.”</p>

  <div class="figright illowp12">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_147.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>It was an Indian custom to mark a warrior’s honors, much as a soldier
    wears stripes for the wounds he has had. I was quite proud of the marks
    on my paddles. I was a young woman, remember, and I thought, “Not every
    woman has a husband as brave as mine.”</p>

  <p>Just before I got into my boat I had paused to wash my sweaty face
    in the river, and, with a little ochre and buffalo fat, I painted my
    cheeks a bright red. I thought this made me look handsome; and, too,
    the paint kept my face from being tanned by the sun, for I had a light
    skin. In those days everybody painted, and came to feasts with handsome
    faces, red or yellow. Now we follow white men’s ways, and we go about
    with faces pale, like ghosts from the Dead village. I think that is why
    some tribes call white men <i>pale-faces</i>; because they do not paint
    and are pale like ghosts.</p>

  <p>Altogether there were eleven boats in our fleet, two to each couple
    except Scar and his wife, who had but one. At that, their one boat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
    was enough, for they had small store of meat or skins to take home.
    They were a young couple and thought more of having a good time than of
    doing any hard work.</p>

  <p>We had launched our boats in a tiny bay, and our paddles, dipping into
    the quiet backwater, sent the waves rippling against the shore. It was
    a crisp spring morning, and the sun, rising almost in our faces, threw
    a broad band of gold over the water. In the shadow of the opposite
    bank, a pelican was fishing. He paused to gaze at us, his yellow beak
    laid against his white plumage; then calmly went to fishing again. Out
    in mid-current, an uprooted tree swept by, and our skin boats, as they
    swung out of the bay, passed a deadhead that bobbed up and down, up and
    down. Then with a roar, the current caught us and bore us swiftly away.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak">HOMEWARD BOUND</h2>
  </div>

  <p>When using her bull boat to cross over the river, a woman knelt in
    the bow and dipped her paddle in front of her; but, with a second and
    freighted boat in tow, my husband and I paddled, seated one at each
    side of our boat. We had not much need to use our paddles as long as we
    rode the current.</p>

  <p>Crow-Flies-High led the way. We had gone, I think, an hour or two, and
    Crow-Flies-High’s boat was rounding a point, when I saw him rise to his
    knees and back water with his paddle. My husband and I speeded up; and,
    as we came near, Crow-Flies-High pointed to the bank just below the
    point. It was thickly covered with buffaloes.</p>

  <p>Scar’s wife put her hand to her mouth for astonishment, but made no
    sound. If buffaloes have not good sight, they have keen ears; and she
    knew better than to cry out.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span></p>

  <p>A bit of woodland stretched along the shore farther on. Crow-Flies-High
    signed for us to follow, and we floated silently down to the end of the
    woods, where the trees hid us from the herd. The men sprang out and
    held the boats while we women landed.</p>

  <p>The bank was high and rather steep, but at its foot was a narrow bench
    of sand a foot or more above the water’s level. We hastily unloaded our
    boats and dragged them out upon this sand.</p>

  <p>Along the Missouri’s edge are always to be found dead-and-dry willow
    sticks, left there by the falling current. I gathered an armful of
    these, and, having climbed the bank, laid them together in a kind of
    floor. Son-of-a-Star now helped me fetch up our bundles, and we piled
    them on this willow floor. He also brought up my two boats. These I
    turned, bottom up, over my pile of bundles, to keep off frost and rain.</p>

  <p>The men now seized their guns and hastened off after the buffaloes. It
    was about noon. I think we had spent less than an hour unloading the
    boats and packing them and our stuff to the top of the bank.</p>

  <p>While our hunters were stalking the herd, we women stayed in camp,
    keeping very quiet, and stilling the dogs if they whined or barked.
    Before long we heard the <i>poh-poh-poh!</i> of guns, and knew the herd
    was started. We now arose and began gathering sticks for a fire. I
    think the first man to return struck fire for us, and we got dinner.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span></p>

  <div class="figright illowp41">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_151.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>We did not trouble to set up our tent. “The weather is not cold,”
    said Crow-Flies-High’s wife. “We can sleep in the open air.” I cut
    buck-brush bushes and spread a robe over them for my bed. Dry grass
    stuffed under one end of the robe did for a pillow. My covering was a
    pair of buffalo skins. We were weary and went to bed early. The night
    was clear; and, with the fresh river air blowing in my face, I soon
    fell asleep.</p>

  <p>We were astir the next morning at an early hour. While Son-of-a-Star
    started a fire, I went to fill my copper kettle at the river. My
    husband had asked me to boil him some meat, for the broth; for in old
    times we Indians drank broth instead of coffee.</p>

  <p>The river’s roar, I thought, sounded louder than usual; and, when I
    reached the edge of the high bank, I saw that the current was thronged
    with masses of ice. This amazed me, for the river had been running free
    for a fortnight. The Missouri is never a silent stream, and now to
    the roar of its waters was added the groaning and crashing of the ice
    cakes, as they grated and pounded one another in the current.</p>

  <div class="figleft illowp39">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_152.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>When the Missouri is running ice, the mid-current will be thronged,
    well-nigh choked, with ice masses, but near the banks, where are
    shallows, the water will be free, since here the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span> stream is not deep
    enough to float the ice chunks. On the side of the river under our camp
    was a margin of ice-free water of this kind; and I now saw, out near
    the edge of the floating ice, two bull boats bound together, with a
    woman in the foremost, paddling with all her might. She was struggling
    to keep from being caught in the ice and crushed.</p>

  <p>I ran down the bank to the bench of sand below, just as the boats
    came sweeping by. The woman saw me and held out her paddle crying,
    “Daughter, save me!” I seized the wet blade, and tugging hard, drew the
    boats to shore. The woman was <i>Amaheetseekuma</i>,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> or Lies-on
    Red-Hill, a woman older than I, and my friend.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27">[27]</a> A mä hēēt´ sēē kṳ mä
  </div>

  <p>Lies-on-Red-Hill, though rather fat, scrambled quickly out of the boat
    and began tumbling her bundles out upon the sand. The other women of
    our party now came down, and we helped my friend carry her bundles up
    to the camp.</p>

  <p>As we sat by the fire, wringing and drying her moccasins,
    Lies-on-Red-Hill told us her story: “My husband, Short Bull, and I were
    hunting buffaloes. We dried much meat, which I loaded in my two boats,
    to freight down the river. While I paddled, Short Bull was to go along
    the shore with our horses. ‘We will meet at Beaver Wood,’ he said, ‘and
    camp.’ But I did not find <span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>him at Beaver Wood. Then ice came. I was
    afraid to camp alone, and tried to paddle down stream, keeping near the
    shore, where was no ice. More ice came, and I feared I should be upset
    and drown.”</p>

  <div class="figright illowp38">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_153.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>It was not until afterwards, when we reached our village, that we
    learned why Short Bull did not meet his wife. He got to Beaver Wood
    ahead of her. Not finding her, and thinking she had passed him, he went
    on to the place where they had agreed to make their second camping.
    When again she did not come, he became alarmed, and returned up the
    river looking for her. In the morning he saw the river was full of ice.
    “She is drowned,” he thought. And he went on to Like-a-Fishhook village.</p>

  <p>Lies-on-Red-Hill’s father was an old man named Dried Squash. He was
    fond of his daughter, and, when he heard she was drowned, he put her
    squash basket on his back and went through the village weeping and
    crying out, “Lies-on-Red-Hill, dear daughter, I shall never see you
    again.” He wanted to leap into the river and die, but his friends held
    him.</p>

  <p>Lies-on-Red-Hill rested in our camp two days. The third morning the
    river was running free again, and she loaded her boats and paddled off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
    down stream. The rest of us stayed one more day, to finish drying and
    packing our meat. Then we, too, loaded our boats and started down the
    river.</p>

  <p>We floated with the current, and the second day sighted Stands-Alone
    Point, or Independence, as white men now call it. Here a party of
    Mandans were just quitting camp. They pushed their boats into the
    current and caught up with us. “We knew you were coming,” they said.
    “Lies-on-Red-Hill told us. She passed us yesterday.”</p>

  <p>Our united party floated safely down until we were two miles below what
    is now Elbowoods. Here, to our astonishment, we found that the current
    was hardly running, and the water was backing up and flooding the
    shores. We rounded a point of land, and saw what was the matter. Ice,
    brought down on the current, had jammed, bridging the river and partly
    damming it.</p>

  <p>Fearing to go farther, we were bringing our boats to land, when we
    heard the sound of a gun and voices calling to us. On the opposite
    shore stood two white men, waving handkerchiefs.</p>

  <p>We paddled across and landed. The white men, we found, were traders,
    who had married Indian women. They had a flat boat, loaded with buffalo
    skins and furs. With them was Lies-on-Red-Hill. One of the traders we
    Indians had named Spots, because he had big freckles on his face.</p>

  <p>Like-a-Fishhook village was yet about fifteen miles away. While the
    rest of our party waited, one of the men went afoot, to notify our
    relatives.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span> They came about noon, the next day, with ponies and saddles
    to help us bring home our goods. The saddles were pack saddles, made
    with horn frames.</p>

  <p>It took four ponies to pack the dried meat and skins my husband and I
    had brought. I loaded my boats on the travois of two of my dogs.</p>

  <p>We reached Like-a-Fishhook village at sunset. Lies-on-Red-Hill came
    with us, to the great joy of her father.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak">AN INDIAN PAPOOSE</h2>
  </div>

  <p>My father was overjoyed to see me and my husband again, and he was glad
    for the store of meat that we brought. We had a real feast the next
    day. I boiled green corn, shelled from the cob and dried the summer
    before, and packed away in skin bags. We were fond of this corn, and
    had little of it left. Strikes-Many Woman parched ripe sweet corn,
    pounded it in a mortar with roast buffalo fats, and kneaded the meal
    into little balls.</p>

  <p>With these corn messes and boiled dried buffalo meat we made a big
    feast and called in all our relatives. To each woman guest, as she went
    away again, I gave a bundle of dried buffalo meat; and I thus gave away
    one of the four pony-loads of meat I had brought home. It was an Indian
    custom that, when a hunter brought in meat of a deer or buffalo, it
    belonged to his wife;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span> and we should have thought her a bad woman, if
    she did not feast her relatives and give to them.</p>

  <p>My father sat with his cronies at the right of the fireplace, at our
    feast. We women ate apart, for men and women do not sit together at an
    Indian feast. I heard my father talking with his friend, Lean Wolf:
    “Every spring, when I was young, we fired the prairie grass around the
    Five Villages. Green grass then sprang up; buffaloes came to graze on
    it, and we killed many.”</p>

  <p>“Those were good days,” said Lean Wolf. “There were many buffaloes
    then.”</p>

  <p>“It is so,” said my father. “It is now seven years since a herd was
    seen near our village. White men’s guns have driven them away. And each
    year we kill fewer deer.”</p>

  <p>“I have heard that some Sioux families starved last winter,” said Lean
    Wolf.</p>

  <p>“They starved, because they are hunters and raise no corn,” said my
    father. “We Hidatsas must plant more corn, or we shall starve; and we
    must learn to raise white men’s wheat and potatoes.” Small Ankle was a
    progressive old man.</p>

  <p>One morning, not long after our feast, Red Blossom came in from the
    woods with news that the wild gooseberry vines were in leaf. This was a
    sign that corn planting time was come, and we women began to make ready
    our corn seed and sharpen our hoes.</p>

  <p>I had been thinking of my father’s words to Lean Wolf. “They are wise
    words,” I told my mothers. “We should widen our fields, and plant more
    corn.” While they busied themselves with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span> planting, I worked with my
    hoe around the edges of our two fields, breaking new ground.</p>

  <p>Having thus more ground to work over, my mothers planted for more than
    a month, or well into June. The last week of our planting, Red Blossom
    soaked her corn seed in tepid water. “It will make the seed sprout
    earlier,” she said, “so that the ears will ripen before frost comes.”</p>

  <p>Our fall harvest was good. My two mothers and I were more than a week
    threshing and winnowing our corn; but some families, less wise than
    ours, had not increased their planting, and had none too much grain to
    lay by for winter. This troubled our chief men. “The summer’s hunt has
    been poor,” they said. “If our winter’s hunting is not better, we shall
    be hungry before harvest comes again.”</p>

  <p>They had twice called a council to talk of the matter, when scouts
    brought word that buffaloes had been seen. “Big herds have come down
    into the Yellowstone country,” they said. The Black Mouths thought
    we should make our winter camp there, in tepees; and they went about
    choosing a winter chief.</p>

  <p>But no one wanted to be winter chief. Camping in the Yellowstone
    country in skin tents, was not like our wintering in earth lodges in
    the woods near our village. The people expected their chief’s prayers
    to keep enemies away and bring them good hunting. If ill luck came to
    any in the camp, they blamed the winter chief.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span></p>

  <p>The Black Mouths offered gifts to one or another of our chief men,
    whose prayers we knew were strong; but none would take them. At
    last, they gave half the gifts to <i>Eydeeahkata</i>,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and half
    to Short Horn. “You shall take turns at being chief,” they said.
    “<i>Eydeeahkata</i> shall lead one day and Short Horn the next.”</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28">[28]</a> E̱y dēē äh´ kä tä
  </div>

  <p>The two leaders chose Red Kettle to be their crier. The evening before
    we started he went through the village crying, “We move to-morrow at
    sunrise. Get ready.”</p>

  <p>Our way led up the Missouri, above the bluffs; and most of the time
    we were within sight of the river. Now and then, if the current
    made a wide bend, we took a shorter course over the prairie.
    <i>Eydeeahkata</i> and Short Horn went ahead, each with a sacred
    medicine bundle bound to his saddle bow. The camp followed in a long
    line. Some rode ponies, but most went afoot. We camped at night in our
    tepees.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illowp100">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_159.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>We made our eleventh camp on the north side of the Missouri, a few
    miles below the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>mouth of the Yellowstone. Here the Missouri is not
    very wide, and its sloping banks make a good place for crossing. A low
    bank of clean, hard sand lay along the water’s edge. We pitched our
    tents about noon on this sand. There were about a hundred tepees. They
    stood in rows, like houses, for there was not room on the sand to make
    a camping circle.</p>

  <p>Small Ankle pitched his tent near the place chosen for the crossing.
    The day was windy and chill. With flint-and-steel my father struck
    a fire, and we soon had meat boiling. After our dinner he drove his
    horses to pasture.</p>

  <p>Strikes-Many Woman fetched dry grass for our beds, spreading it thickly
    on the floor against the tent wall. On the edges of the beds next the
    fireplace she laid small logs, to keep in the grass bedding and to
    catch any flying sparks from the fire.</p>

  <p>The wind died at evening. Twilight fell, and the coals in the fireplace
    cast a soft, red glow on the tent walls. I sat near the tent door. With
    robe drawn over my shoulders to keep off the chill, I raised the skin
    door and looked out. The new moon, narrow and bent like an Indian bow,
    shone white over the river, and the waves of the swift mid-current
    sparkled silvery in the moonlight. I could hear the swish of eddies,
    the lap-lapping of the waves rolling shoreward. Over all rose the roar,
    roar, roar of the great river, sweeping onward we Indians knew not
    where.</p>

  <p>My dogs were sleeping without, snugged against the tent for warmth.
    At midnight one of them stirred, pointed his nose at the moon and
    broke into a howl. The howl soon grew to a chorus, for every dog
    in the camp joined in. Far out on the prairie rose the wailing
    <i>yip-yip-yip-yip-ya-a-ah!</i><a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> of a coyote. The dogs grew silent
    again, and curled up, nose-in-tail, to sleep.</p>

  <p>And my little son came into the world.</p>

  <p>The morning sky was growing light when Son-of-a-Star came into the
    tent. His eyes were smiling as he stepped to the fireplace, for they
    saw a pretty sight. Red Blossom was giving my baby a bath.</p>

  <p>She had laid him on a piece of soft skin, before the fire. With horn
    spoon she filled her mouth with water, held it in her cheeks until it
    was warm, and blew it over my baby’s body. I do not think he liked his
    bath, for he squalled loudly.</p>

  <p>My husband laughed. “It is a lusty cry,” he said. “I am sure my son
    will be a warrior.”</p>

  <p>Having bathed my baby, Red Blossom bound him in his wrapping skins. She
    had a square piece of tent cover, folded and sewed along the edges of
    one end into a kind of sack. Into this she slipped my baby, with his
    feet against the sewed end. About his little body she packed cattail
    down.</p>

  <p>On a piece of rawhide, she put some clean sand, which she heated by
    rolling over it a red-hot stone. She packed this sand under my <span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>baby’s
    feet; and, lest it prove too hot, she slipped a piece of soft buckskin
    under them.</p>

  <p>Over all she bound a wildcat skin, drawing the upper edge over the
    baby’s head, like a hood.</p>

  <p>The hot sand was to keep my baby warm. This and the cattail down we
    placed in a baby’s wrappings only in winter, when on a journey.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Small Ankle and other members of the family were making ready
    to cross. “We must hasten,” my father said. “Ice chunks are running on
    the current this morning. This shows that up in the mountains the river
    is freezing over and cold weather is setting in.”</p>

  <p>My mothers began packing soon after breakfast and Son-of-a-Star came
    in to say that he would take me across in our bull boat; for we had
    brought one with us from the village. Old Turtle began unpinning the
    tent cover while I was still inside. She made the tent poles into a
    bundle and bound them at the tail of the boat. I stepped in with my
    baby in my arms and my husband paddled the boat across.</p>

  <p>Son-of-a-Star helped me up the bank on the other side and gave me a
    place to sit where I could watch the crossing. I folded a robe to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span> sit
    upon, and, with another robe drawn snugly over my shoulders and my baby
    in my arms, I felt comfortable and warm.</p>

  <p>My husband even made a small fire in a hollow place in the ground
    near-by. One of my women friends boiled some meat and gave me the hot
    broth to drink; for I was weary with the work of crossing and caring
    for my babe.</p>

  <p>There were not enough boats in the camp for all the people. Most of the
    old people and little children were brought over in boats, and some
    of the camp goods; but many families floated their stuff over in tent
    covers, and, cold as was the water, many of the men swam.</p>

  <p>I had left my two mothers and old Turtle loading their tent cover.
    Turtle had made a big noose in the end of a lariat and laid it on the
    sand. Over this she spread the skin cover, a large one. She bent a
    green willow into a hoop, laid it on the tent cover, and within the
    hoop piled most of our camp goods. She now gathered the edges of the
    cover together over the pile, drew tight the noose, and tied it firm.
    This tent-cover bundle my mothers and old Turtle pushed out into the
    water as a kind of raft. The willow hoop gave the raft a flat bottom so
    that it did not turn over in the water.</p>

  <p>The lariat that bound the mouth of the raft was fastened to the tail of
    a pony we had named Shaggy, and the end was carried into and about the
    pony’s mouth like a halter. Shaggy was driven into the stream and swam
    across, towing the raft. The lariat was fastened to his tail so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span> that,
    if the raft was swept down stream by the current, it would not drag the
    pony’s head, and turn him from his course.</p>

  <div class="figright illowp62">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_167.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>As I have said, many families floated their goods over in these
    tent-cover rafts; and not a few women, in haste to cross, swam clinging
    to their rafts. One woman put her little four-year-old son on the top
    of her raft, while she swam behind, pushing and guiding it. Another old
    woman, named Owl Ear, mounted her raft and rode astraddle. Her pony
    landed in a place where the shore was soft with oozy mud, so that he
    could not climb out. Owl Ear had to wade in the mud up to her middle to
    get her raft ashore; and when she was climbing out she slipped and sat
    down backwards again in the ooze. She came up sputtering mud from her
    mouth and much vexed with herself. “I think there must be bad spirits
    in that mud, and they are trying to pull me back,” she called to me, as
    she came waddling up the steep bank.</p>

  <p>Before evening my mothers had brought all their camp goods across. They
    raised the poles of our tent and drew on the cover. It was wet, but
    soon dried in the wind. We built a fire inside. My baby had wakened up
    and was crying.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span> I loosened his wrapping and warmed him by the tent
    fire, and he soon fell asleep. Red Blossom dug a hole, slipped into it
    a kind of sack of raw hide, for a mortar. We had brought a pestle with
    us from the village, and with this we pounded parched corn to a meal to
    boil with beans. We ate a late supper and went to bed.</p>

  <p>We camped on the bank three days, until all had crossed. Our chiefs
    would not remain longer, for they wanted to get into winter camp before
    snow fell; and, on the morning of the fourth day, we struck tents and
    made ready to march.</p>

  <div class="figleft illowp47">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_168.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>There was a mule in our family herd, a slow-going, gentle beast, that
    I had bought of a Sioux for a worthless pony and some strings of corn.
    Son-of-a-Star harnessed this mule to a travois, and my baby and I
    rode. Had our march been in olden days, I should have had to go afoot,
    carrying my baby on my back.</p>

  <p>My husband had spread a heavy bull-skin robe over the travois basket
    and set me on it, with another skin folded under me for a cushion.
    Through holes in the edge of the bull skin Son-of-a-Star passed a
    lariat; and when I was seated, with my baby in my arms and my robe
    belted snugly about us, my husband drew the lariat, drawing the bull
    skin about my knees and ankles.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span> The day was windy and cold, and the
    bull skin kept the chill air from me and my babe.</p>

  <p>Our leaders had chosen for our winter camp a place called Round Bank,
    on a small stream named Bark Creek. There were no trees here for
    building earth lodges, so we camped in our tepees, pitching them in a
    hollow, to shelter them from the wind. The ground was frozen so that we
    could not peg our tents to the ground, but laid stones around the edges
    of the tent covers. Such was our older-fashioned way. We did not use
    wooden tent pegs much until after we got iron axes.</p>

  <p>My mothers fetched dry grass into our tent for our beds, and made a
    fire under the smoke hole. A tepee was kept warm with a rather small
    fire, if it was well sheltered from the wind.</p>

  <p>Ours was a big tent, for we had a big family. With my two half
    brothers, Bear’s Tail and Wolf Chief, and their wives; and Red Kettle,
    Full House, and Flies Low, younger sons of Red Blossom and Strikes-Many
    Woman, we numbered fourteen in all. This was a large number for one
    tent. Ten were as many as a tepee usually sheltered. Every member of
    the family had his own bed, where he slept at night and sat in the
    daylight hours.</p>

  <p>My little son was ten days old the second day we were in winter camp;
    and, though we were hardly well settled, I found time to make ready his
    naming feast. Having filled a wooden bowl with venison and boiled dried
    green <span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>corn—foods I knew well were to his liking—I set it before Small
    Ankle.</p>

  <p>“I want you to name your grandson,” I said to him.</p>

  <div class="figleft illowp39">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_170.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>Small Ankle ate, thinking the while what name he should give my son.
    Then he arose and took my baby tenderly in his arms, saying, “I name
    him <i>Tsakahka Sukkee</i>,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Good Bird.” Small Ankle’s gods were
    birds, and the name was a kind of prayer that they remember and help my
    little son.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_30" href="#FNanchor_30">[30]</a> Tsä käh´ kä Sŭk´ kēē
  </div>

  <p>Winter passed without mishap to us. We had found no buffaloes on the
    Yellowstone; but our hunters thrice discovered small herds near our
    camp and brought in meat; and a good many deer were killed.</p>

  <p>Rather early in the spring, the women of the Goose Society danced and
    hung up meat for the goose spirits, praying them for good weather for
    corn planting. Then we all broke camp.</p>

  <p>Most of the tribe returned to the Yellowstone for the spring hunt, but
    my father wanted to go up the Missouri. “We have not found the herds
    our scouts saw in the fall,” he said. “I am sure they are farther up
    the river.” One Buffalo and his family joined us and we went up the
    river and made camp. A small herd was sighted and ten buffaloes were
    killed.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span></p>

  <p>We were building stages to dry the meat when four more tents caught up
    with us, those of Strikes Backbone, Old Bear, Long Wing, and Spotted
    Horn, and their families. To each tent owner my father gave a whole
    green buffalo hide and a side of meat. The hides were for making bull
    boats, for we were planning to return home by water.</p>

  <p>Ice broke on the Missouri and flocks of wild ducks began coming north.
    My mothers were eager to be home in time for the spring planting. I
    made four new boats, giving one of them to my father, and we made ready
    to go.</p>

  <p>Son-of-a-Star partly loaded one of my boats with dried meat, and put
    in his gun and ax. A second boat, also partly loaded, he lashed to the
    first; and a third, loaded to the gunwale with meat and hides, he bound
    to the tail of the second. In this second boat sat my half brother,
    Flies Low, a seventeen-year-old lad, with my baby in his arms. My
    husband and I sat in the first boat and paddled.</p>

  <p>There were eleven boats in the six families of our party. One or two
    families, having no meat to freight, rode in single boats. My father
    and two of the men did not come in the boats, but rode along the bank,
    driving our horses. They kept back near the foot hills, but in sight of
    the river.</p>

  <p>We were in no haste, and we made a jolly party as we floated down the
    broad current. At night we paddled to the shore. The men joined us with
    the horses, and we camped under the stars.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span></p>

  <p>The Missouri is a swift stream, and at places we found the waves were
    quite choppy. Especially if a bend in the river carried the current
    against the wind, the waves rolled and foamed, rocking our boats and
    threatening to swamp us. At such times we drew together, catching hold
    of one another’s boats. Thus bunched, our fleet rode the choppy current
    more safely than a single boat could have done.</p>

  <p>The weather had set in rather warm when we left our winter camp and the
    grass had already begun to show green on the prairie. But, as we neared
    the mouth of the Little Missouri, a furious storm of snow and wind
    arose. The storm blew up suddenly, and, as we rounded a bend in the
    river, we rode into the very teeth of the wind.</p>

  <p>Son-of-a-Star shouted to me to turn in to the shore, though I could
    hardly hear his voice above the wind. We plied our paddles with all our
    might. Suddenly my husband stopped paddling and leaned over the side of
    the boat, nigh upsetting it. “<i>Eena, eena</i>”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> I cried, scared
    nearly out of my wits, and I grasped at the boat’s edge to keep from
    being tumbled in upon him. Then I saw what was the matter. My husband
    was lifting my little son out of the water.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_31" href="#FNanchor_31">[31]</a> ēē nä´
  </div>

  <p>I have said that Flies Low sat in our second boat, with my little son
    in his arms. The baby had grown restless, and Flies Low had loosened
    the babe’s wrappings to give freedom of his limbs. A sudden billow
    rocked the boat, throwing Flies Low against the side and tumbling my
    little son out of his arms into the water.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span></p>

  <div class="figcenter illowp100">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_173.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>His loosened wrappings, by some good luck, made my baby buoyant, so
    that he floated. He was crying lustily when my husband drew him out;
    but he was not strangling, and under his wraps he was not even wet.</p>

  <p>“I could not help it,” said Flies Low afterwards. “The boat seemed to
    turn over, and the baby fell out of my arms.” We knew this was true and
    said nothing more of it.</p>

  <p>Our party reached shore without further mishap. We hastily unpacked two
    tents; and, while some busied themselves pitching them, others gathered
    wood and made fires.</p>

  <p>That night the snow turned to a cold rain, which the next day turned
    again into a heavy snow. The summer birds had come north, and after the
    storm was over we found many of them frozen to death. It snowed for
    four days.</p>

  <p>Small Ankle and his brother, Charging Enemy, were driving their horses
    along the bank when the storm overtook them. They did not stop to camp
    with us, but pushed on through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span> the storm to Like-a-Fishhook village.
    They reached the village safely and drove their horses down into the
    thick timber out of the cold wind. There was a pond there, and the
    horses found it warmer to wade out into the water than to stand on the
    bank in the cold rain. But after a while, grown weary with standing,
    they came out; and, as the wind was blowing a gale, the horses were
    chilled and three of them died. Many others of our village herd died in
    the same way.</p>

  <p>Our own party, as soon as the storm was over, re-embarked and floated
    safely down to Like-a-Fishhook village.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak">AFTER FIFTY YEARS</h2>
  </div>

  <p>I am an old woman now. The buffaloes and black-tail deer are gone, and
    our Indian ways are almost gone. Sometimes I find it hard to believe
    that I ever lived them.</p>

  <p>My little son grew up in the white man’s school. He can read books, and
    he owns cattle and has a farm. He is a leader among our Hidatsa people,
    helping teach them to follow the white man’s road.</p>

  <p>He is kind to me. We no longer live in an earth lodge, but in a house
    with chimneys; and my son’s wife cooks by a stove.</p>

  <p>But for me, I cannot forget our old ways.</p>

  <p>Often in summer I rise at daybreak and steal out to the cornfields;
    and as I hoe the corn I sing to it, as we did when I was young. No one
    cares for our corn songs now.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span></p>

  <p>Sometimes at evening I sit, looking out on the big Missouri. The sun
    sets, and dusk steals over the water. In the shadows I seem again
    to see our Indian village, with smoke curling upward from the earth
    lodges; and in the river’s roar I hear the yells of the warriors, the
    laughter of little children as of old. It is but an old woman’s dream.
    Again I see but shadows and hear only the roar of the river; and tears
    come into my eyes. Our Indian life, I know, is gone forever.</p>

  <p><i>Page 9, l. 24</i>: “We had corn a-plenty” The Hidatsas and Mandans
    were the best agriculturists of the north-plains Indians. Varieties
    of corn developed by them mature in the semi-arid climate of western
    North Dakota where our better known eastern strains will not ripen.
    The varieties include flint, flour, and a kind of sweet corn called
    <i>maikadishake</i>,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> or gummy, which the Indians use for parching.
    Hidatsa seed planted at the United States Agricultural Experiment
    Station at Bozeman, Montana, has made surprising yields.</p>

    <a id="Footnote_32" href="#FNanchor_32">[32]</a> mä´ ï kä dï shä kĕ
  </div>

  <p><i>Page 10, l. 29</i>: “the ghost land.” A Hidatsa Indian believed he
    had four ghosts. At death, one ghost went to the Ghost village, to live
    in an earth lodge and hunt buffaloes as on earth; a second remained at
    the grave until after a time it joined the first in the Ghost village
    where they became one again. What became of the other two ghosts does
    not seem to be known.</p>

  <p><i>Page 11, l. 20</i>: “The march was led by the older chiefs.” A
    Hidatsa chief was a man who by his war deeds, hospitality, and wisdom,
    came to be recognized as one of the influential men of the tribe.
    He was not necessarily an officer. When translating into English,
    Hidatsas usually call the officer elected for any executive duty a
    <i>leader</i>, as war-party leader, winter-camp leader, leader of the
    buffalo hunt. It should be remembered that the activities of an Indian
    tribe are decided in councils; and in these councils the eloquence and
    wisdom of the chiefs had greatest weight. The Hidatsa word for chief,
    literally translated, is excellent man, superior man.</p>

  <p><i>Page 13, l. 8</i>: “At this hour fires burned before most of the
    tepees.” In fall or winter the fire was within the tepee, under the
    smoke hole.</p>

  <p><i>Page 15, l. 13</i>: “for a woman to ... begin building her earth
    lodge.” While the work falling to an Indian woman was far from light,
    she did not look upon herself as overburdened. Women were more kindly
    treated by Hidatsas and Mandans than by some tribes.</p>

  <p><i>Page 17, l. 28</i>: “dried prairie turnips.” The prairie turnip,
    <i>psoralea esculenta</i>, is a starchy, bulbous root, growing rather
    plentifully on the plains. Its food value is high. Attempts have been
    made unsuccessfully to cultivate it.</p>

  <p><i>Page 17, l. 30</i>: “June berries.” The June berry, <i>amelanchier
    alnifolia</i>, is a small, hardwood tree, bearing sweet, dark-red
    berries. Its branches were much used for making arrow shafts.</p>

  <p><i>Page 21, l. 14</i>: “young men fasted and cut their flesh.” Such
    self-inflicted tortures were not, as is often believed, for the
    purpose of proving the warrior’s fortitude, but were made as a kind of
    sacrifice to the gods that these might pity the devotee and answer his
    prayers. See Bible, I Kings, XVIII; 28.</p>

  <p><i>Page 24, l. 30</i>: “It was a long pipe with black stone bowl.” The
    stone bowl was carved from a hard kind of grey clay, anointed with
    grease and baked in a fire to turn it black. It took a high polish.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

  <p><i>Page 35, l. 11</i>: “Telling tales ... in ... autumn and winter.”
    Tribal myths, told of the gods, were often forbidden in summer
    when nature was <i>alive</i>. In winter nature was <i>asleep</i>
    or <i>dead</i>. One could talk of sleeping spirits without fear of
    offending them.</p>

  <p><i>Page 36, l. 5</i>: “Making ready her seed.” The Hidatsas used the
    greatest care in selecting their seed corn. Only large and perfect ears
    were chosen. The best ear for seed was the <i>eeteeshahdupadee</i>,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
    or muffled-head, so called because the kernels cover the cob quite to
    the tip, making the ear look like an Indian with his head muffled up in
    his robe.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_33" href="#FNanchor_33">[33]</a> ēē tēē shä dṳ´ pä dēē
  </div>

  <p><i>Page 36, l. 14</i>: “Wooden bowl.” In olden days almost every family
    owned several of these feast bowls. A large knot was split out of a
    tree trunk with wedges and, after being hollowed out with fire, was
    slowly carved into shape with flint tools. Some of these bowls are
    beautiful examples of carving.</p>

  <p><i>Page 37, l. 16</i>: “Trying to parch an ear of corn.” Parched corn
    entered largely into the diet of our corn raising Indians. Among
    eastern tribes, a warrior set forth on a long journey with a sack of
    parched corn pounded to a meal. When hungry, he swallowed a spoonful of
    the parched meal, washing it down with a pint of water. In a short time
    the meal had absorbed the water, filling the stomach with a digestible
    mass like mush.</p>

  <p>Every farmer’s lad should put away some ears of ripened sweet corn in
    the fall, to parch of a winter’s evening. Sweet corn was raised by the
    Hidatsas and Mandans for parching only.</p>

  <p><i>Page 38, l. 21</i>: “Ground beans,” or hog peanut; <i>amphicarpa
    falcata</i>. These beans, like peanuts, are borne under ground.</p>

  <p><i>Page 38, l. 22</i>: “Wild potatoes,” or Jerusalem artichoke. Roots
    of <i>helianthus tuberosus</i>, a plant of the sunflower family.</p>

  <p><i>Page 41, l. 25</i>: “Who had been a black bear.” Tradition has it
    that the art and mysteries of trapping eagles were taught the Hidatsas
    by the black bears. An eagle hunters’ camp was conducted as a kind of
    symbolic play, the hunters acting the ceremonies of the delivery to the
    Indians of the eagle-hunt mysteries.</p>

  <p><i>Page 44, l. 17</i>: “Earth lodges well-built and roomy.” The earth
    lodge of the Mandans and Hidatsas was the highest example of the
    building art among our plains tribes. Some of these lodges were quite
    large, having a height of eighteen feet or more, and a floor diameter
    exceeding sixty feet. Usually two or more families of relatives
    inhabited the same lodge.</p>

  <p>An earth lodge had four large central posts and beams, supporting the
    roof; twelve surrounding posts and beams, supporting the eaves; and a
    hundred rafters. The roof was covered with a matting of willows over
    which was laid dry grass and a heavy coating of earth.</p>

  <p>An earth lodge lasted but about ten years, when it was abandoned or
    rebuilt. The labor of building and repairing these imposing structures,
    especially in days when iron tools were unknown and posts and beams had
    to be burned to proper lengths, must have been severe.</p>

  <p>When the author first visited Fort Berthold reservation in 1906, there
    were eight earth lodges still standing; in 1918 there were two.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span></p>

  <p><i>Page 47, l. 18</i>: “An earthen pot.” The potter’s craft was
    practiced professionally by certain women who had purchased the secrets
    of the art. The craft was an important one, as much of Hidatsa cooking
    was by boiling. Some of the earthen boiling pots held as much as two
    gallons. A collection of earthen pots, fired in 1910 by Hides-and-Eats,
    a Mandan woman nearly ninety years old, is in the American Museum of
    Natural History.</p>

  <p><i>Page 49, l. 18</i>: “From her cache pit.” The cache pit was a
    jug-shaped pit within or without the lodge, six or eight feet deep. It
    was floored with willow sticks and its walls were lined with dry grass.
    It was used to store the fall harvest.</p>

  <p>Strings of braided ears were laid in series against the wall. Within
    these was poured the threshed grain, in which were buried strings of
    dried squash and sacks of beans and sunflower seed. Buffalo-Bird Woman
    says there were five cache pits in use in her father’s family.</p>

  <p>Many families had a cache pit within the lodge to serve as a cellar.
    Besides corn for immediate use, it held sacks of dried berries, prairie
    turnips, packages of dried meat and even bladders of marrow fat.</p>

  <p>The pits without the lodge with their stores of grain were carefully
    sealed with slabs and grass, over which were trampled earth and ashes.
    This was done to conceal the pits from any Sioux who might come
    prowling around when the tribe was away in winter camp. If a family
    lacked food in winter, they returned to their summer village and opened
    one of these cache pit granaries for its stores of corn.</p>

  <p><i>Page 49, l. 31</i>: “Red Blossom pounded the parched corn ... in a
    corn mortar.” The corn mortar, or hominy pounder, is a section of a
    cottonwood or ash trunk, hollowed out by fire. The pestal is of ash.
    The mortar was sunk in the floor of the earth lodge and covered, when
    not in use, by a flat stone.</p>

  <p>Corn mortars are still used by the Hidatsas. Our grandmothers in
    pioneer days also used them.</p>

  <p><i>Page 51, l. 4</i>: “Chief.” A Hidatsa chief, as explained, was
    not necessarily a tribal officer. His position was like that of an
    influential citizen of a country village, who is often a member of
    the local school or hospital board, is chosen to preside at patriotic
    meetings, and is expected to extend hospitality and charity to those in
    need.</p>

  <p>Hospitality, indeed, is the Indian’s crowning virtue. In tribal days,
    when one had food, all had food; when one starved, all starved. A
    reservation Indian does not like to take pay for a meal, especially
    from one of his own race; and he can not comprehend how any white man
    having food can let another go hungry.</p>

  <p>His hospitality is often a hindrance to the Indian’s progress. Indolent
    Indians eat up the food stores of industrious relatives.</p>

  <p><i>Page 56, l. 14</i>: “Dried meat pounded fine and mixed with marrow
    fat.” This was regarded as a delicate dish. Old people especially were
    fond of it. The plains Indians usually had sound teeth, but their
    coarse diet wore the teeth down so that old men found it hard to eat
    dried meat unless it was thus pounded to shreds. Marrow fat was used
    much as we use butter.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span></p>

  <p><i>Page 57, l. 1</i>: “A doll, woven of rushes.” Very good mats were
    also woven of rushes.</p>

  <p><i>Page 58, l. 4</i>: “Tossing in a blanket.” The blanket tossing game
    has been found among widely separated peoples. In Don Quixote, we are
    told how Sancho Panza unwilling participated in the game.</p>

  <p><i>Page 66, l. 6</i>: “Every Hidatsa belonged to a clan.” The clan
    was, nevertheless, relatively weak among the Hidatsas, its functions
    apparently having been usurped at least in part by the age societies.
    (The Black Mouths were an age society. See chapter V).</p>

  <p>In many tribes a man was forbidden to marry within his clan.</p>

  <p><i>Page 68, l. 25</i>: “He was a great medicine man.” The story of
    Snake Head-Ornament is a good example of the tales told of the old time
    medicine men. Snake Head-Ornament’s friendship for the bull snake would
    seem uncanny even to a white man.</p>

  <p><i>Page 73, l. 1</i>: “In old times we Indian people had no horses.”</p>

  <p>At the time of America’s discovery the Indians had domesticated the
    llama in the Peruvian highlands; the guinea pig, raised for food by
    many South American tribes; turkeys, and even bees, in Mexico; dogs,
    developed from wolves or coyotes, were universally domesticated among
    the North American tribes.</p>

  <p>Indian dogs were used as watch dogs and as beasts of burden. Dog flesh
    was eaten by many tribes. An edible, hairless variety of dog, bred by
    the Mexican Indians has become extinct.</p>

  <p><i>Page 77, l. 23</i>: “My grandmother brought in some fresh sage.” The
    sage was a sacred plant.</p>

  <p><i>Page 81, l. 10</i>: “Our dogs dragged well-laden travois.” Older
    Indians say that a well-trained dog could drag a load of eighty pounds
    on a travois.</p>

  <p><i>Page 85, l. 6</i>: “The big tendon ... we Indians call the
    <i>eetsuta</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> When dried this tendon becomes hard, like horn;
    and arrow points and even arrow shafts were carved from it.</p>

  </div>

  <p><i>Page 87, l. 32</i>: “Coyote Eyes, a Ree Indian.” The Rees, or
    Arikaras, are an offshoot of the Pawnee tribe, whose language they
    speak. They removed to Fort Berthold reservation and settled there with
    the Hidatsas and Mandans in 1862.</p>

  <p><i>Page 92, l. 7</i>: “To embroider with quills of gull.” The tribe
    used to make annual journeys to the lakes near Minot, North Dakota,
    where, older Indians say, the gulls nested. The feathers were gathered
    along the beach. The quill was split, the flat nether half being the
    part used. Quills were dyed with native vegetable colors.</p>

  <p><i>Page 99, l. 10</i>: “Bear Man was an eagle hunter.” The tail
    feathers of the golden eagle were much worn by all the plains tribes.
    These feathers, in eagles under two years of age, are of a pure white,
    with dark brown or black tips, and were much prized. Eagle hunting was
    a highly honored occupation.</p>

  <p><i>Page 112, l. 17</i>: “The huskers came into the field yelling and
    singing.” Buffalo-Bird Woman laughingly adds, that the yelling was by
    young men who wanted their sweethearts to hear their voices.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span></p>

  <p><i>Page 114, l. 2</i>: “The hollow buffalo hoofs rattled.” The earth
    lodge door was a heavy buffalo skin, stretched when green on a frame
    of light poles. It was swung from the beam above by heavy thongs. The
    puncheon fire screen stood between it and the fireplace, about which
    the family sat or worked. As the moccasined tread of a visitor made
    little noise, a bunch or two of buffalo hoofs was hung to a bar running
    across the middle of the door.</p>

  <p>The hoof was prepared by boiling and removing the pith. Its edges were
    then trimmed and a hole was cut in the toe. Through this hole a thong
    was run with a knotted end, to keep the hoof from slipping off. As the
    door dropped after an entering visitor, the hollow hoofs fell together
    with a clittering noise, warning the family.</p>

  <p><i>Page 118, l. 28</i>: “Hanging Stone.” A literal translation of the
    Hidatsa word. It refers to a form of war club, a short stick, from an
    end of which swung a stone sewed in a piece of skin.</p>

  <p><i>Page 125, l. 3</i>: “With ankles to the right, as Indian women sit.”
    A warrior sat Turkish fashion, or, often, squat-on-heels. An Indian
    woman sat with feet to the right unless she was left-handed, when feet
    were to the left.</p>

  <p><i>Page 125, l. 6</i>: “Mixed with marrow fat.” Marrow fat was obtained
    by boiling the crushed bones of a buffalo in a little water. The yellow
    marrow as it rose was skimmed off and stored in bladders or short
    casings made of entrails, like sausage casings.</p>

  <p><i>Page 126, l. 10</i>: “I have come to call you.” Buffalo-Bird Woman
    means that her father invited his son-in-law to come and live in his
    earth lodge. If he had not sent this invitation, the young couple would
    have set up housekeeping elsewhere.</p>

  <p><i>Page 128, l. 37</i>: “Only a strong, well-fed pony could go all
    day on wet ground.” Nature designed the solid hoof of the horse for
    a prairie or semidesert country. A pony finds it hard to withdraw
    his hoof in wet spongy soil, and soon tires. A deer or buffalo, with
    divided hoof, runs upon wet ground with comparative ease. Every
    farmer’s boy knows that an ox will walk through a swamp in which a
    horse will mire.</p>

  <p><i>Page 142, l. 26</i>: “With two fingers crooked like horns, the sign
    for buffaloes.” So many languages were spoken by our Indian tribes,
    that they found it necessary to invent a sign language so that Indians,
    ignorant of each other’s speech, could converse. A well-trained deaf
    mute and an old plains Indian can readily talk together by signs.</p>

  <p><i>Page 143, l. 4</i>: “Creeping up the coulees.” A coulee in the
    Dakotas is a grassy ravine, usually dry except in spring and autumn,
    and after a heavy rain.</p>

  <p><i>Page 157, l. 19</i>: “They starved, because they are hunters and
    raise no corn.” The Hidatsas and Mandans as agriculturists felt
    themselves superior to the hunting tribes. Small-Ankle refers here to
    the western, or Teton, Sioux. The eastern Sioux were corn raisers.</p>

  <p><i>Page 158, l. 10</i>: “My mothers and I were more than a week
    threshing.” In the summer of 1912, the author had Buffalo-Bird Woman
    pace off on the prairie the size of her mothers’ field, as she
    recollected it. It measured one hundred and ninety yards in length by
    ninety yards in width. Such were some of the fields which in olden days
    were cultivated with wooden sticks and bone hoes.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak">HOW TO MAKE AN INDIAN CAMP</h2>
  </div>

  <p>Young Americans who wish to grow up strong and healthy should live much
    out of doors; and there is no pleasanter way to do this than in an
    Indian camp. Such a camp you can make yourself, in your back yard or an
    empty lot or in a neighboring wood.</p>

  <h3>The Lodge</h3>

  <p>Buffalo-Bird Woman has told us of the earth lodges of her people. They
    were for permanent abode. Hunters, however, camping but a day or two in
    a place, usually put up a pole hunting lodge.</p>

  <p>Four forked poles were stacked, as in Figure 1.</p>

  <div class="center">
    <div class="col50 illowp40">
      <div class="figcenter">
        <img class="w100" src="images/i_183a.jpg" alt="" />

        <div class="caption">Figure 2</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Around these in a circle, other poles were laid, as in Figure 2, for a
    frame.</p>

  <p>For cover buffalo skins, bound together at the edges, were drawn around
    the frame in two series, the lower series being laid first. The peak of
    the pole frame was left uncovered, to let out the smoke.</p>

  <p>Instead of buffalo skins, gunny sacks may be used, fastened at the
    edges with safety pins or with wooden skewers; or strips of canvas or
    carpet may be used. Three or four heavier poles may be laid against the
    gunny-sack cover to stay it in place.</p>

  <p>The door may be made of a gunny sack, hung on a short pole.</p>

  <p>Indians often raised a piece of skin on a forked pole for a shield, to
    keep the wind from driving the smoke down the smoke hole.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span></p>

  <p>Figure 3 shows the finished lodge with gunny-sack cover, door, and wind
    shield. The last is made of a piece of oil cloth.</p>

  <h3>Booth</h3>

  <p>Buffalo-Bird Woman tells of the booth which Turtle made in her
    cornfield. A booth is easily made of willows or long branches.</p>

  <p>A short digging stick will be needed. This was of ash, a foot or two
    in length, sharpened at one end by burning in a fire. The point was
    often rubbed with fat and charred over the coals to harden it. (Such a
    digging stick was not the kind used for cultivating corn.)</p>

  <p>If you have no ash stick, a section of a broom handle will do.</p>

  <p>With a stone, drive the digging stick four inches in the ground, as in
    Figure 4. Withdraw digging stick and repeat until you have six holes
    set in a circle. The diameter of the circle should be about five feet.</p>

  <p>Into the six holes set willows, or branches, five or six feet high, as
    in Figure 5.</p>

  <p>Weave or bind tops together so as to make a leafy roof, or shade, as
    in Figure 6. For binding, use strips of elm bark; or slender willows,
    twisted, so as to break the fibers.</p>

  <h3>Fireplace</h3>

  <p>Indians, when journeying, made the campfire outside the lodge in
    summer; inside the lodge, in winter. Usually a slight pit was dug for
    the fireplace, thus lessening danger of sparks, setting fire to prairie
    or forest. The fire was smothered with earth when camp was forsaken.</p>

  <h3>Broiling Meat</h3>

  <p>Indians broiled fresh meat on a stick thrust in the ground and leaning
    over the coals. Often a forked stick was cut, the meat was laid on the
    prongs, and it was held over the coals until broiled. In Figures 7 and
    8 both methods are shown.</p>

  <h3 class="noclear">Drying Meat</h3>

  <p>Buffalo-Bird Woman often speaks of dried buffalo meat. If you want to
    know what it was like, cut a steak into thin pieces, and dry on a stage
    of green sticks, three feet high. This may be done in the sun; or, a
    small fire may be made beneath, to smoke as well as dry the meat. In
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
    Figures 9 and 10 two forms of drying stage are shown.</p>

  <div class="figleft illowp56">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_186a.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Figure 10</div>
  </div>

  <h3 class="noclear">Cooking Dried Meat</h3>

  <p>A pail or small bucket will do for kettle. It should be swung from a
    tripod by stick-and-thong, as in Figure 11. Put in dried meat with
    enough water to cover, and bring to a boil. The broth may be used as
    the Indians used it, for a drink.</p>

  <h3>Parching Corn</h3>

  <p>Ripe sweet corn, thoroughly dried, is best for parching; but field corn
    will do nearly as well. Drop a handful of the shelled corn in a skillet
    with a little butter. Cover skillet and set on the fire. Shake skillet
    from side to side to keep corn from scorching.</p>

  <p>In the earth lodge, Hidatsa women parched the grain in an earthen pot,
    stirring it with a stick. Indian boys, when out herding horses, often
    carried two or three ears of corn for lunch. An ear was parched by
    thrusting a stick into the cob, and holding it over the coals, as in
    Figure 12.</p>

  <p>A steak broiled Indian fashion over the coals, or a kettle of boiled
    dried meat, with a cupful of parched corn, will make just such a meal
    as Indians often ate.</p>

  <p>Do not throw away bits of unused food, but burn or bury them. Unless
    thus destroyed, the decaying food will attract insects, which often
    bring disease. Bury all tin cans.</p>

  <p>Potatoes may be kept fresh as in your cellar by burying them in loose
    earth or sand.</p>

  <p>Hang out your blankets and bed clothing to be aired an hour or two each
    day, preferably in the morning.</p>

  <p>Indians had no soap. Indian women scoured out their earthen cooking
    pots with rushes. You may clean your camp kettle and pans in the same
    way; or, if no rushes can be found, scour with coarse grass dipped in
    wet sand or sandy mud, and drench with clean water.</p>

  <p>Axes, clothing, shoes, and the like may be stored out of the way by
    making them into a long bundle, with a cloth or thick paper, and
    lashing them to one of the upright tent poles within the tent.</p>

  <p>Indian children were fond of chewing green cornstalks, for the sweet
    juice they contained. If your camp is near a cornfield about the time
    the corn is in milk, you will find the chewed stalks almost as sweet as
    some varieties of sugar cane.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak">INDIAN COOKING</h2>
  </div>

  <p>Young people often wonder what Indian cooking is like, and groups of
    them—as a class in Sunday school or day school—may like to eat a meal
    of Indian foods. Following are a few common Hidatsa dishes. Usually,
    but one kind of food was eaten at a single meal.</p>

  <div><b>Madapozhee Eekteea<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></b>, <i>or Boiled Whole Corn</i></div>

  <p>Pour three pints of water into a kettle and set on the fire. Drop in
    a pint of shelled field corn, a handful of kidney beans and a lump of
    suet the size of an egg. Boil until the corn kernels burst open.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_35" href="#FNanchor_35">[35]</a> Mä dä pō´ zhēē Ēēk tēē´ ä
  </div>

  <div><b>Manakapa</b><a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>, <i>or Mush</i></div>

  <p>Put a pint of shelled field corn into a canvas cloth, and with ax or
    stone pound to a coarse meal; or the corn may be ground in a coffee
    mill. To this meal add a handful of kidney beans, and boil in two pints
    of water. The Hidatsa mortar for pounding corn into meal is shown in
    cut on page 156.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_36" href="#FNanchor_36">[36]</a> Mä´ nä kä pä
  </div>

  <div><b>Dried, or Jerked, Meat</b></div>

  <p>Cut some beefsteak, round or sirloin, into thin strips. Dry the strips
    on a stage of small poles (see cut on page 141) in the open air or over
    a slow fire, or in the kitchen oven, until brittle and hard. Meat thus
    dried could be kept for months. Warriors and hunters often ate jerked
    meat raw or toasted over a fire. In the lodge, it was more often boiled
    a few minutes to soften it; and the broth was drunk as we drink coffee.
    (See also “Drying Meat”, page 185.)</p>

  <div><b>Pemmican</b></div>

  <p>Take strips of beef, dried as described above, and pound them to shreds
    between two hard stones. Put the shredded mass in a bowl, and pour over
    it a little marrow fat from a boiled soup bone, or some melted butter.</p>

  <div><b>Corn Balls</b></div>

  <p>The Hidatsas raised sweet corn for parching. Hunters often carried a
    pouch of the parched grain for a lunch. Parched ripe sweet corn was
    often pounded to a fine meal, kneaded with lumps of hot roasted suet,
    and rolled between the palms into little lumps, or balls, the size of
    one’s thumb.</p>

  <p>Hidatsa custom did not permit a woman to speak to her son-in-law; but
    she often showed her love for him by making him a bowl of corn balls.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak">EDITOR’S NOTE</h2>
  </div>

  <p>Surrounded by the powerful and hostile Sioux, the two little Hidatsa
    tribes were compelled to keep relatively close to their stockaded
    villages and cornfields, which, however, they most sturdily defended.
    Their weakness proved a blessing. The yearly crops of their cornfields
    were a sure protection against famine, and in their crowded little
    villages was developed a culture that was remarkable. The circular
    earth lodges of the Mandans and Hidatsas represent the highest
    expression of the house-building art east of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

  <p>Three members of Small Ankle’s family are now living: Small Ankle’s
    son, Wolf Chief, his daughter, Waheenee, or Buffalo-Bird Woman, and
    her son, Good Bird, or Goodbird. Goodbird was the first Indian of his
    tribe to receive a common school education. Like many Indians he has a
    natural taste for drawing. Several hundred sketches by him, crude but
    spirited and in true perspective, await publication by the Museum.</p>

  <p>Goodbird’s mother, Waheenee, is a marvelous source of information of
    old-time life and belief. Conservative, and sighing for the good old
    times, she is aware that the younger generation of Indians must adopt
    civilized ways. Ignorant of English, she has a quick intelligence and
    a memory that is marvelous. The stories in this book, out of her own
    life, were told by her with other accounts of scientific interest for
    the Museum. In the sweltering heat of an August day she has continued
    dictation for nine hours, lying down but never flagging, when too weary
    to sit longer in a chair. She is approximately 83 years old.</p>

  <p>The stories in this book are true stories, typical of Indian life.
    Many of them are exactly as they fell from Waheenee’s lips. Others
    have been completed from information given by Goodbird and Wolf Chief,
    and in a few instances by other Indians. The aim has been not to give
    a biography of Waheenee, but a series of stories illustrating the
    philosophy, the Indian-thinking of her life.</p>

  <p>In story and picture, therefore, this book is true to fact and becomes
    not only a reader of unusual interest but a contribution to the
    literature of history and of anthropology. The author and the artist
    have expressed and portrayed customs, places, and things that are
    purely Indian and perfect in every detail.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
